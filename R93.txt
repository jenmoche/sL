Because i don’t want to talk about UPSC aspirants who are just wasting seats and printing back up degrees with 4-5/10 GPA). Litigation is trash, if you are able to land a firm gig or a inhouse role you are golden. Just know most legal jobs will be replaced by AI so unless you are passionate and good at law and critical thinking, dont come to this profession&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
