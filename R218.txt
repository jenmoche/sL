Debt: Opinions on loans, EMIs, and credit—financial stress often tests even the strongest bonds.\n\n3. Retirement goals: Align on visions of your later years—working till 60, retiring early, or living off the grid?\n\n4. Cultural and lifestyle expectations: Festive traditions, food preferences (veg/non-veg), and daily rituals can influence compatibility more than you'd expect.\n5. Future career plans\n6. Mutual Physical + emotional + intellectuals attraction and compatibility. Both party should like and enjoy each other company.\n\n7. Overall intension about this marriage. It’s actually easy to find out if someone is looking for a real life long relationship or someone just trying to find someone to exploit.\n\n8. Good heart, kindness, empathy for other people\n\n9.
