My house has always been in crisis, disease and disorder; thus, I had no idea that one should think about and for their career in school and how there are permanent consequences of your action, committed so far back. I don’t blame them; we were cursed, and they tried everything to help me. Some quiet and personal space in the house was never an option, fighting and screaming was the only way). Money had always been an issue, with our medicines costing more than what we could afford. The only idea I had of a job something that I could use to make enough money to support my family and bring them out of their misery.\n\n \n\nSomewhere along the line, I forgot my initial purpose. I lost my will to write and as soon as I was introduced to what the “corporate” thinks is fit for artistic endeavors, I lost my respect and love for writing (as a career) as well. Writing to make a fool out of people, to attract them into buying some crappy product with inflated value and going by ambiguous metrics to increase things like ‘CTR’ and impressions, is still not even the last thing I want to do. I am fed up. This task is all evil to me (possibly, as the last firm I worked for was a poorly organized startup that only wanted to pickpocket people with their half-assed product).\n\n \n\nI was one of the people who were fooled with “the humanities/arts stream has a lot of opportunities too, science is over-rated”; and boy, did it come back to bite.

This field feels intriguing and grasps my novice/child-like interest with its vague big picture, but yes, interest needs to stem from somewhere, no matter how vague. No lie that careers in science, economics and other practical disciplines pay more (while maintaining the abuse of a worker’s rights and attesting horrid work hours, but hey, at least I would be going home with some money).  \n  \nShould I pursue some computer science/ application oriented degree ( correspondence – via IGNOU) after saving for an year and so; pursue some Data Science and Analytics courses from Coursera, side by side and look for a future here?  \n  \nI did think about preparing for government examinations (SSC and UPSC are the only examinations I know), wasted my time, didn’t/couldn’t sit for an attempt due to family crisis and all; and I know how impossible it is to get these jobs and how long it takes for an appointment as well – again, can’t risk it.

I desperately need career advice (in general) and for switching to discipline/careers with a good pay – keeping the Indian job market in mind.   \nBody:  \n\nHello to all, I hope you can read this, this is my only resort to gaining some advice.\n\nI have worked previously as a content writer and now, I am working as a prompt engineer for a company. I undertook English (literature) as my graduation degree because I used to write a lot, was good at it and was encouraged by my teachers (who were my only hope and indirect source of career guidance) to take up writing as a career. I wanted to undertake journalism for my graduation but couldn’t make the cut-off due to my subject choices and had to go with English Literature (the second-best option, could hardly afford a government university much less a private one).  \n  \nNever really knew what career I wanted to pick with writing, always thought of something along the lines of a newspaper columnist (imitating a friend that I knew) and what not (I never had any career guidance, I was burdened with taking care of my family at a young age, be it medically or any other way. My house has always been in crisis, disease and disorder; thus, I had no idea that one should think about and for their career in school and how there are permanent consequences of your action, committed so far back. I don’t blame them; we were cursed, and they tried everything to help me. Some quiet and personal space in the house was never an option, fighting and screaming was the only way). Money had always been an issue, with our medicines costing more than what we could afford. The only idea I had of a job something that I could use to make enough money to support my family and bring them out of their misery.\n\n \n\nSomewhere along the line, I forgot my initial purpose. I lost my will to write and as soon as I was introduced to what the “corporate” thinks is fit for artistic endeavors, I lost my respect and love for writing (as a career) as well. Writing to make a fool out of people, to attract them into buying some crappy product with inflated value and going by ambiguous metrics to increase things like ‘CTR’ and impressions, is still not even the last thing I want to do. I am fed up. This task is all evil to me (possibly, as the last firm I worked for was a poorly organized startup that only wanted to pickpocket people with their half-assed product).\n\n \n\nI was one of the people who were fooled with “the humanities/arts stream has a lot of opportunities too, science is over-rated”; and boy, did it come back to bite. I scored well (above average and in the good range) in school and was a very jovial and happy go lucky kid, oblivious to the world; a crappy example of those “kids with great potential”.

I desperately need career advice (in general) and for switching to discipline/careers with a good pay – keeping the Indian job market in mind.&lt;br/&gt;\nBody:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello to all, I hope you can read this, this is my only resort to gaining some advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have worked previously as a content writer and now, I am working as a prompt engineer for a company. I undertook English (literature) as my graduation degree because I used to write a lot, was good at it and was encouraged by my teachers (who were my only hope and indirect source of career guidance) to take up writing as a career. I wanted to undertake journalism for my graduation but couldn’t make the cut-off due to my subject choices and had to go with English Literature (the second-best option, could hardly afford a government university much less a private one).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never really knew what career I wanted to pick with writing, always thought of something along the lines of a newspaper columnist (imitating a friend that I knew) and what not (I never had any career guidance, I was burdened with taking care of my family at a young age, be it medically or any other way. My house has always been in crisis, disease and disorder; thus, I had no idea that one should think about and for their career in school and how there are permanent consequences of your action, committed so far back. I don’t blame them; we were cursed, and they tried everything to help me. Some quiet and personal space in the house was never an option, fighting and screaming was the only way). Money had always been an issue, with our medicines costing more than what we could afford. The only idea I had of a job something that I could use to make enough money to support my family and bring them out of their misery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line, I forgot my initial purpose. I lost my will to write and as soon as I was introduced to what the “corporate” thinks is fit for artistic endeavors, I lost my respect and love for writing (as a career) as well. Writing to make a fool out of people, to attract them into buying some crappy product with inflated value and going by ambiguous metrics to increase things like ‘CTR’ and impressions, is still not even the last thing I want to do. I am fed up. This task is all evil to me (possibly, as the last firm I worked for was a poorly organized startup that only wanted to pickpocket people with their half-assed product).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was one of the people who were fooled with “the humanities/arts stream has a lot of opportunities too, science is over-rated”; and boy, did it come back to bite. I scored well (above average and in the good range) in school and was a very jovial and happy go lucky kid, oblivious to the world; a crappy example of those “kids with great potential”. I never could see how bad of a bog I was in as I spent the most of my time (in school) around kids that were well to do and had luxurious concerns – it acted like an escape for me and I loved to escape, even for a moment, from the trouble was in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have seen what artistic career opportunities offer – a heap load of stress, abuse from the employer, horrid working hours and a salary that rarely ever goes beyond Rs 30 – 35k (can’t do that due to the medicines in my house already taking up around 10-15k).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t go for that; I have been there and it is utter crap.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of switching to data analytics and data science (and now I see how big of a buzzword it is; and how I could be seeing this just as an escape).
