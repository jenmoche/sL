Maths is mandatory for a lot of degrees so it's best to just have it in your group. \n\nIf you think you can score passing marks. Then do take maths as well. Take tuitions for maths or extra help.

Maths is mandatory for a lot of degrees so it&amp;#39;s best to just have it in your group. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think you can score passing marks. Then do take maths as well.
