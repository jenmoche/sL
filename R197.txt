And a comment which my manager made was \" A lot of folks are MOVED to an L&amp;D role and not because they choose to\" \n\nI would suggest not to look at big MNC's because they have KPI's to get peeps from tier 1 tier 2 colleges first and like you mentioned focusing too much on MBA's. However your best bet is mid size to mid range MNC's, smaller consultancies and startups.\n\nWith mid size MNC's you will mostly work with international managers and stakeholders which is great, and you can gain alot of growth pretty quickly. \n\nWith startups - you mostly won't learn much but it'll get you foot in the door.\n\nWith smaller consultancies ( yes external L&amp;D consultancies are pretty popular) you will mostly be made to work ALOT but if you are clever enough you'll get aLOT of exposure and possibility to move to the clients side if you impress them enough. \n\nSo you have to understand the context that most of these dudes were either - HR / TA professionals, folks from Operations moving into a training role, and the worst of the lot- failed engineers. \n\nSo there is very very less emphasis on understanding Human behaviour and how we (psych students) as L&amp;D folks can get learners more engaged. Unfortunately, the KPI's of most of these dudes are \" force training and fulfil dept KPI\" and that's not the best way to look at it. I found out that atleast 90% of the speakers have realised the importance of having someone with a I/O Psych degree in the space and how it can better promote learner engagement. Learning analytics is also a pretty important skill imo.\n\n\n\nI went to a conference last year and was really shocked to find out I was the youngest L&amp;D professional by a large margin and the boomers were really only focused on \"KPI and ROI\".\n\nTHAT BEING SAID .there are a bunch of great people from India out there who understand the impact and importance of learning cultures and how to promote them, as well as pretty good Instructional Designers. \n\nI can suggest a few to you later on.",

You can definitely reach out :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad the knowledge and experience I gained along the way is helpful to others in the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah there&amp;#39;s a fair load of people who are closed off because the Indian mentality towards training and development is really backward. And a comment which my manager made was &amp;quot; A lot of folks are MOVED to an L&amp;amp;D role and not because they choose to&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would suggest not to look at big MNC&amp;#39;s because they have KPI&amp;#39;s to get peeps from tier 1 tier 2 colleges first and like you mentioned focusing too much on MBA&amp;#39;s. However your best bet is mid size to mid range MNC&amp;#39;s, smaller consultancies and startups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With mid size MNC&amp;#39;s you will mostly work with international managers and stakeholders which is great, and you can gain alot of growth pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With startups - you mostly won&amp;#39;t learn much but it&amp;#39;ll get you foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With smaller consultancies ( yes external L&amp;amp;D consultancies are pretty popular) you will mostly be made to work ALOT but if you are clever enough you&amp;#39;ll get aLOT of exposure and possibility to move to the clients side if you impress them enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to understand the context that most of these dudes were either - HR / TA professionals, folks from Operations moving into a training role, and the worst of the lot- failed engineers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there is very very less emphasis on understanding Human behaviour and how we (psych students) as L&amp;amp;D folks can get learners more engaged. Unfortunately, the KPI&amp;#39;s of most of these dudes are &amp;quot; force training and fulfil dept KPI&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s not the best way to look at it. I found out that atleast 90% of the speakers have realised the importance of having someone with a I/O Psych degree in the space and how it can better promote learner engagement. Learning analytics is also a pretty important skill imo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a conference last year and was really shocked to find out I was the youngest L&amp;amp;D professional by a large margin and the boomers were really only focused on &amp;quot;KPI and ROI&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT BEING SAID .there are a bunch of great people from India out there who understand the impact and importance of learning cultures and how to promote them, as well as pretty good Instructional Designers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can suggest a few to you later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

                      "body": "Firstly you will need to be up to date with the principles of adult learning theories - that is the ADDIE model, SAM model, Gagnes 9 events , Blooms taxonomy.\n\n\nNext up comes the authoring tools- these are advanced presentation tools which allow you to create  interactions for learners, be it animations, assessments, and all sorts of games as well. \n\nAre you familiar with the ADDIE model, and authoring tools like - Articulate storyline/Rise and Storyboarding with those tools? They are good to start with. I recommend checking out courses on Udemy and LinkedIn learning and I can suggest those to you. The other authoring tools you would use is Adobe Captivate/ Elucidate/Lectora. \n\n\nSoon after this you will need to learn about program evaluation. I would suggest starting with Kirkpatrick evaluation levels, those are great for first time learners if you don't know it already. \n\nAfter this good pluses to have would be video content editing skills, Vyond, Adobe Lightroom etc (Vyond is an animation tool and should be farely simple to use) and other good video editing tools are - Davinci, and the more complex one is Adobe Premiere Pro \n\nLastly good skills to add on is to understand how to use/leverage GenAI it'll help you alot throughout your journey whenever you are stuck at any point.

I started my career just 2 years back in L&amp;D, just after completing my masters in I/O Psych in Bangalore. After 6 months of searching and crying and getting frustrated over not getting an L&amp;D job , I started with an internship for 6months at a company as an LMS( learning Management system - it's like an internal training website for the company) Administrator and now I'm an L&amp;OD senior specialist within 2 years. \n\n\nTo get started in the first place - easiest way is to search for content development jobs within the L&amp;D space, get acquainted with instructional design and Kirkpatrick's evaluation models. Familiarise yourself with authoring tools like Adobe captivate, Articulate 360 and Vyond.\n\nResearch on LMS's what they are and how you use them. ( I will share a more in-depth career guide here)\n\nSoon after this reach out to recruiters with a cover letter. If you can't reach out to recruiters, reach out to AVP's and VP's of L&amp;D departments. \n\nThis is apart from applying to jobs on LinkedIn Naukri and Indeed. \n\nStart building your network, add people to the relevant industry and you will see that they will also repost job postings. \n\nAll the best, it's gonna be a tough hustle to start your first job because getting into L&amp;D is like a nestled secret for old boomers xD. But if you are open to learning ops roles, content development and instructional design roles/LMS and E-learning Specialist roles in the beginning your in. \n\nSoon after that you can start building your career pathways in OD because in most if not all orgs - OD is a part of L&amp;D and vice versa- they work hand in hand. \n\nWhen it comes to quiting your job, I would say it's a risk either way. It'll take a while for you to get into L&amp;D. I would do one of two things:\n\n1. Either work in my current job and upskill myself and update my resume on the side while applying for ID jobs.\n2. Leave where I work and take time to upskill , evaluate options and target opportunities which I want.\n\nBoth options are alright since you are just starting out your career. Do whichever one appeals to you the most. One option has the safety of your job , and the other has you devoting all your time and energy to where you want to be. \n\nBut either way it's not a bad thing to start on an unrelated career path and then gravitate towards L&amp;D when you get the job. People in corporate do that all the time! \n\nAll the best and good luck !",
