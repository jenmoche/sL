My short-term goal is to break into IB post-MBA, but long-term, I plan to return to India and transition into PE/VC or a similar role.\n\nOn the surface, it seems like Stern is the obvious choice given its proximity to Wall Street and strong IB pipeline. However, I’ve heard a few things that are making me reconsider and would love your input:\n\n1.\tKellogg as a “sleeper” IB school – I’ve read that despite its reputation for marketing/consulting, Kellogg actually has similar IB outcomes to Stern. Is that true? How does recruiting really compare at both schools?\n\n2.\tChanging goals post-MBA – Many people say that once you’re in school and exposed to different industries, it’s common to pivot from your original plan. If this is true and one might pivot from their original plans, does it make more sense to choose the M7 school (Kellogg) over a finance-heavy but slightly more specialized one (Stern)?\n\n3.\tBrand value in India + exit opps – When I eventually move back to India, which school’s brand would carry more weight in helping me transition into PE/VC or similar roles? I know Kellogg has a stronger global/M7 brand, but does that matter more than Stern’s IB strength?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or personal experiences from those who’ve made similar decisions or have insights into IB recruiting at either school.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
