I need a solution so please provide a geniune advice.\nHi I am 32M Indian and have done B.Tech Electrical Engineering from a decent college in 2018. After Completing my degree due to a family emergency I was not able to apply for any company. So in 2020 I did Apprenticeship from a well known Fertilizer Company.  It was a big plant which generates it's own Power using GTG and distribute power to various substation across the plant for use. I completed my Apprenticeship by late 2021. After this i didn't joined any other company though I had opportunity, as i always wanted to do something of my own. Also realised that preparing for a government job is better than a private job. \nSince I am from electrical background, so i prepared for UPPCL exam but it never happened. \nAround 2023 I started working on my own website (the work I used to love, I have previous experience in creating website during college times on WordPress). My website started generating revenue but since it was starting phase so not much revenue. Fast forward 2024, my family wanted me to do a job instead, so I joined Delhivery as a Team Lead but quit the job after 2 month as it was affecting my health. \nNow at present I am working on my website but the revenue is still very low. Since I am getting old my family also want me to get married. In 3 months I am about to get married without a proper income source.\nI just don't know what to do, please help me get out of this mess. \nI am ready to pivot to any other field also, but need a start in my stagnant career. I don't know if I can get a job at my age in India or not. Or should I look for job outside of India or at my age what skills can get me a job. \nI applied to many companies in my domain but looks like due to age and gap in my resume, they do not revert back.",
