I (25F) have been torn between being with my partner (27M) or calling it off and I really need some help here.\n\nContext 1- the main argument has broken out because my partner feels it is selfish of me to want to go study abroad after marriage. I have always wanted to go for a masters of (1-2 years) in my late 30s because in my field masters is more academic and does not have a good ROI, so I would like to save up by then, build a nice resume and experience the education that good universities provide. I am very interested in academic learning and I would like to keep exploring education both online and offline throughout my life.\n\nContext 2- My partner, however, has a steady job and has recently purchased a house in this city where he works and wants to live. He unfortunately lost his father some years ago, and is a single child, so he is the main bread winner of the family and supports his mom financially.\n\nI am yet not settled well in my career and it would take me 1-2 years easily to reach there. Moreover, his mother wants him to get married by the end of next year max because she would like some stability + fears there is no one behind her to care for her son. I completely get this, but I do not feel mentally, or financially ready for marriage yet, or in near future.\n\nWhen we started dating (a year ago), I fell really hard for him and could imagine my future with him and had no problems compromising on my marriage timeline because I felt I could pursue my dream career (UPSC) even after marriage. I even told him that I have this dream of earning an LLM from abroad one day. He used to be very supportive in words back then, we even discussed how nice it would be if he and I lived together as I found it hard to go for many dates because of my prep (so naive now I think).\n\nBut it started changing, he feels that I am a selfish person who lacks empathy because I only want to prioritise myself and my career and do not understand the situation his family is in (that his mother is a widow). He feels going abroad after marriage would be a difficult situation for the family but after many arguments says that he is ready to support me in my career forever (as my job could be transferrable should I get into UPSC), but would want us to prioritise his family (which he says I should also do because it would be mine).\n\nI feel confused because sometimes I get that any family would want stability and hence nobody might be okay with it, especially his mother’s fears after losing her husband suddenly and tragically. But at the same time “we will navigate together in the future” sounds to me like he is just shrugging it off right now because he thinks I will probably never bring it up again or if I do, he will be able to show me the \"responsibilities\".\n\nI am unable to understand the kind of problems my education will pose to his family that makes it such an uncomfortable situation for him. The only thing that comes to mind is that he fears that his mother will have to take care of the household (or maybe kids) for a year or two and is not okay with it?\n\nI don’t understand this because he is open to me having a career where my job would largely be transferrable and we might live separately for many days of the week/month. I sometimes feel he is not logically thinking things through and feels that he would be able to manipulate me into prioritising family and togetherness and I would eventually somehow manage postings in our current city or something like that would be “managed”.\n\nI find it weird but then I also think that perhaps nobody would want to put up with this and everyone would want a traditional home where both people work in the same city, mother and children are taken care of by both, his life doesn’t change much and I just get added into it. I faced these issues even in my past relationship (of only 4 months lol) where the guy could not fathom a woman with a transferable career.\n\nI legit lost interest in my career for some months after all that happened. But now, I feel like I want to be in a relationship where I am supported to achieve my potential and even pushed out of my comfort zone by my partner. I see how so many people say they didn’t believe in themselves but their family pushed them to achieve something. In my case, I feel that if we ended up together, his mother would always come before me, and I will always be asked to sacrifice for their comfort.\n\nWhen I voiced this out, he said he hates my mentality and thinks I am a very selfish person with no empathy and am unable to support him. I will admit, even I have started feeling like the current phase of my life has made me selfish (UPSC prep), and I feel like it is necessary because when I was not, I was unable to devote any time to my studies (everyone else's timelines and priorities ate into my time).\n\nI am really sorry for the long post but I wanted to give as much context as I can to not paint a white or black image of him. I think he loves me a lot, and is very loyal, and I like him a lot, but I am unable to shrug off the feeling that he is trying to control me.\n\nThere is a lot more context but idk how to provide all that in one post. Simply put, I am unable to know if I am wanting the right things or am I trying to use him for my benefit in a way that it only serves my interests.\n\nTLDR - I need help with 2 things -\n\n1. Partner thinks it is selfish to go abroad for masters after marriage as his mother is a widow and I should understand the family responsibilities as well (he think she would want stability after marriage). He is okay with a transferable job in India though. \n2. I think I want to be in a relationship that supports me but I am unable to know if I am being selfish by not supporting my partner in what he wants (marriage by next year, and maybe prioritising family later on).\n\nKindly help.",

Your partner's concerns are understandable too. He feels responsible for his mother and he is almost 30. But the fact that he’s ok with you having a transferable job in India but not going abroad for a short while suggests that the real concern might not be logistics it could be a deeper fear of distance, losing connection because you are just 25 and even after 2 years if you guys are not on the same page you can find matches while for him it might be difficut. The way he frames your ambition as ‘selfish’ is concerning not because he doesn’t have the right to feel insecure, but because it suggests he might expect your life to mould around his, while his doesn’t adjust for yours. \n\n Lets be clear Indian job gives you peanuts but if you have a masters and are in a different country you might have a better pay option ergo a better lifestyle, savings etc.. but that would also mean long term relocation and maybe his mother might not agree with that, and it might be a better optionfor her to be in India. Truthfully you are in a good position now for masters. I have not seen many married individuals getting their masters after marriage because life is unpredictable. My mother had completed her master's before marriage and dreamed of a PhD but despite having help from grandparents and house help she couldn’t finish it. After five years of trying she had to give up. So if you have the chance to pursue your dreams now I strongly recommend you take it. It’s ok to want a relationship that supports your ambition. And it’s ok for him to want a life rooted in his responsibilities. But if those visions can’t stretch to include each other’s needs, then love alone may not be enough to carry you both forward. \n\nIn the end, marriage is about two individuals sharing goals and values and it’s never a 50/50 it could be 90/10, 0/100, or 30/70. This isn’t about who’s right or wrong. It’s about whether your current relationship can hold the weight of both your futures without one of you feeling stifled or forgotten. If staying with him would mean repeatedly compromising your dreams, or if being with you makes him feel unstable and resentful, those are red flags about long term compatibility not just current conflict. India’s patriarchal society often favors men in marriage so think carefully before agreeing to anything. He may say you are his family but at the end of the day you are your protector.",

You play it be the near and like her boyfriend said, he is willing to navigate this in the future. The only way I can see it working is when the kids are teens. \nBut she wants to get married after 2 years which I also recommend. At 27-28 if she gets married, most people these days want to spend 2-3 years minimum child free to get to know each other. I also recommend that. She wants to go for her LLM in her late 30s. If she has a kid the kid will not be a teen in her late 30s. \n\nAlso, as sad as it may be, every child is different and come with a set of different needs and most kids need their mom more than their dad during this phase. Ask any teenager and they’ll tell you. \nI personally know women who either started working again or went for higher education but that was only when the kid finished graduation or at least was a done with their first board exam. And in all these cases they were requested by the kids to wait. \nIf she said she would want to go abroad in her mid to late 40s, everyone would encourage it. \nIm not saying that it’s not possible in her late 30s too, I am saying that right now, planning such a strong move will always seem selfish.  And if the guy isn’t comfortable with it, its understandable.",

The circumstances just worked for them. Thats how it should be. You play it be the near and like her boyfriend said, he is willing to navigate this in the future. The only way I can see it working is when the kids are teens. \nBut she wants to get married after 2 years which I also recommend. At 27-28 if she gets married, most people these days want to spend 2-3 years minimum child free to get to know each other. I also recommend that. She wants to go for her LLM in her late 30s. If she has a kid the kid will not be a teen in her late 30s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as sad as it may be, every child is different and come with a set of different needs and most kids need their mom more than their dad during this phase. Ask any teenager and they’ll tell you. \nI personally know women who either started working again or went for higher education but that was only when the kid finished graduation or at least was a done with their first board exam. And in all these cases they were requested by the kids to wait. \nIf she said she would want to go abroad in her mid to late 40s, everyone would encourage it. \nIm not saying that it’s not possible in her late 30s too, I am saying that right now, planning such a strong move will always seem selfish.  And if the guy isn’t comfortable with it, its understandable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
