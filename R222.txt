            "selftext": "Hello ,\n\nSo I am a 4th year undergraduate student at IIT K [B.tech](http://B.tech) in EE (8.53/10) and have a ppo from one of the very chill sde company(Oracle) which will give me 38lpa cash(per tax) at the each year in my bank account (apart from that 3lakhs relocation extra + 4lakh gratity etc etc bullish) .\n\nHowever I want to switch towards quant/ finance focused roles. So since I want to build a long lasting career in this field, I made plans to persue masters in financial engineering. But after hearing the diffcult situation my seniors are going throught to search internships as no company (in finance sector other than quant which is very few) is ready to do the paper work for CPT for international students. So this is kind of scary given the expensive fees of this program. So I need your guys help and different views based on this situation, I am stating down all the pros and cons of my situations along with my stats so that I can give a complete picture:-\n\n**My\\_qualifications:**\n\n1. IIT K [B.tech](http://B.tech) in EE(8.53/10 , Academic excellence award)\n2. 4 research papers ( 1 in upcomming in a finance journal (high impact factor + first authorship), (1 in SemEval conference , on core NLP for LLMs) , (1 in IEEE Date , Graph GANs , high impact factor for VLSI conference) (1 in FICC Springer , under a reputed professor at University college london , who is the director of the Ms in Computational finance )\n3. FRM Level 1 (qualified) , Advancded calculus for financial engineering application (Baruch , currently doing it)\n4. 7 internships ( all of them were paid, Oracle, ISB Hyd, Univeristy college london, IISc blr, Lohum, and 2 startups in finance field) leads to about 2.5 years of experience\n5. GRE- 168Q 146V , TOEFL - 101 (25 28 24 24) like I know I did not prepare for this , as I had a national hackathon on the next day which I managed to win 2nd place and got 1.7lakhs but messed up gre.\n6. 1650 codeforces idk if it matters like I only gave like 6 contests at max and stopped\n7. KVPY , IndianAI fellowship, etc etc, random scholarships which I picked up\n\n**Aiming for Colleges** : Baruch, Princestone, CMU, Cornell, Columbia, Yale, Georgia Tech, University of Chicago , NYU Courant, MIT\n\n**Pros for masters:**\n\n1. I really want to do quant finance, and I am scared if I get in my current company, I might get really comfortable with the money as my parents do not earn much , we must earn just to not get the EWS reservation.\n2. Colleges like georgia tech, baruch and University of chicago, I might end up with net positives and might not need to pay tution fees and break even by then end of 1.5years and have a good degree in hand.\n3. My research work can probably get convert to genuine PHDs which can help with microfinance loans and get some genuine real life effect (basically to poor people without any credit score)\n\nIssue is that my gre score is a big big big issue espically verbal but I will only have to sumbit scores to CMU, Cornell, yale and georgia tech and nyu ( but all of them on their webinars have stated that they only look at quant scores , idk how genuine are they but they stated this)\n\nAnother issue is my funding, I will have to take a really expensive loan of (64k to 150k dollars) as my parents cannot afford to pay this amount of money. I am poor .\n\n**Pros for a job:**\n\n1. Oracle is soo chill , like at max in a day , you only got 2-3 hours of work, and my entire team during my internship used to come to office at 12, lunch break from 1-2:30 , and then leave by 5. This gives me alot of time to upskill and do more codeforces to get more rating to try for indian quants but work life balance in them is really really bad.\n2. Money is really good, like compared to google, microsoft, . my company pays slighty more, and gets less work out from people too.\n3. Shift to cooporate research, Due to my profile, I am currently in talks with my hr and manger to shift me to join at the research labs, my earnings will increase by like 5-7lakhs at max but it will give me more number of research papers allowing me to build a strong profile for O1 visa.\n\n**Applications**: I have applied to 2 programs as of now:\n\n1. University of Chicago (MS in financial Maths)\n2. Georgia Tech (MS-Quantitaive finance and MS-CSE(high performance computing) (yes 2 masters in 2 years)\n\nBut as I am apply for others , I am getting second thoughts and at the end of the day, I want to go to US to change my career to be a real quant trader as jobs in india are not found.\n\nAnother issue is that I will end up spending alot of money on ivy education and if I do not get allocated the H1B visa lottery, then I will have to apply for the talent visa(o1 ) and I have started to notice that a lot of people have started to buy citations and publications and in LinkedIn, there are startups advertising research papers for sale along with citations, this is really scared.\n\nSo please please help me to make a decision.\n\n  \nEdit ::-- My issue rn is that , should I settle with the comfortable job or else gamble alot of money for something which will make me earn mad money in usa like HFT level money",

So I need your guys help and different views based on this situation, I am stating down all the pros and cons of my situations along with my stats so that I can give a complete picture:-\n\n  \n**My\\_qualifications:**\n\n1) IIT K B.tech in EE(8.53/10 , Academic excellence award)\n\n2) 4 research papers ( 1 in upcomming in a finance journal (high impact factor + first authorship), (1 in SemEval conference , on core NLP for LLMs) , (1 in IEEE Date , Graph GANs , high impact factor for VLSI conference) (1 in FICC Springer , under a reputed professor at University college london , who is the director of the Ms in Computational finance )\n\n3) FRM Level 1 (qualified) , Advancded calculus for financial engineering application (Baruch , currently doing it)\n\n4) 7 internships ( all of them were paid, Oracle, ISB Hyd, Univeristy college london, IISc blr, Lohum, and 2 startups in finance field) leads to about 2.5 years of experience\n\n5) GRE- 168Q 146V , TOEFL - 101 (25 28 24 24) like I know I did not prepare for this , as I had a national hackathon on the next day which I managed to win 2nd place and got 1.7lakhs but messed up gre.\n\n6) 1650 codeforces idk if it matters like I only gave like 6 contests at max and stopped\n\n7) KVPY , IndianAI fellowship, etc etc, random scholarships which I picked up\n\n**Aiming for Colleges** : Baruch, Princestone, CMU, Cornell, Columbia, Yale, Georgia Tech, University of Chicago , NYU Courant, MIT\n\n  \n**Pros for masters:** \n\n1) I really want to do quant finance, and I am scared if I get in my current company, I might get really comfortable with the money as my parents do not earn much , we must earn just to not get the EWS reservation.\n\n2) Colleges like georgia tech, baruch and University of chicago, I might end up with net positives and might not need to pay tution fees and break even by then end of 1.5years and have a good degree in hand.\n\n3) My research work can probably get convert to genuine PHDs which can help with microfinance loans and get some genuine real life effect (basically to poor people without any credit score)\n\nIssue is that my gre score is a big big big issue espically verbal but I will only have to sumbit scores to CMU, Cornell, yale and georgia tech and nyu ( but all of them on their webinars have stated that they only look at quant scores , idk how genuine are they but they stated this)\n\n**Pros for a job:** \n\n1) Oracle is soo chill , like at max in a day , you only got 2-3 hours of work, and my entire team during my internship used to come to office at 12, lunch break from 1-2:30 , and then leave by 5. This gives me alot of time to upskill and do more codeforces to get more rating to try for indian quants but work life balance in them is really really bad.\n\n2) Money is really good, like compared to google, microsoft, . my company pays slighty more, and gets less work out from people too.\n\n3) Shift to research, Due to my profile, I am currently in talks with my hr and manger to shift me to join at the research labs, my earnings will increase by like 5-7lakhs at max but it will give me more number of research papers allowing me to build a strong profile for O1 visa.\n\n\n\n**Applications**: I have applied to 2 programs as of now:\n\n1) University of Chicago (MS in financial Maths)\n\n2) Georgia Tech (MS-Quantitaive finance and MS-CSE(high performance computing) (yes 2 masters in 2 years)\n\nBut as I am apply for others , I am getting second thoughts and at the end of the day, I want to go to US to change my career to be a real quant trader as jobs in india are not found. \n\n  \nAnother issue is that I will end up spending alot of money on ivy education and if I do not get allocated the H1B visa lottery, then I will have to apply for the talent visa(o1 ) and I have started to notice that a lot of people have started to buy citations and publications and in LinkedIn, there are startups advertising research papers for sale along with citations, this is really scared.\n\n  \nSo please please help me to make a decision.\n\n  \"\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
