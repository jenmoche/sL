However, if you can add 2 years of work experience, you will have a great CV. \n\nYour plan of action should look something like this: \n1. Keep doing quant and aptitude and give gobarmint exams as usual and CAT too for the exposure.\n2. Look for internships as a master's student. \n3. Since you are an economist, spend some time into learning data analysis.\n4. Work for 2 years, then get a MBA.",

From next year my plan is to first get a decent job especially in finance fields and work on my skills along preparation of govt exam As I wasted my 2 year during distance mba. So I want to tell you that don't depend on single things do multiple things. \n\nMy advice to you -Make a base plan like short term and long term goal. \nIn SHORT short term goal u can work on your skill along with postgraduate whether u do regular or distance doesn't matter just remember u have to focus on skills too with good marks.\nIn LONG term goal do some internship with regular or distance college after learning some skills till 2 years don't focus on MONEY just focus on SKILLS after 2 year of experience and Post graduation your market value will be high enough.\n\nWhat was My mistake - During first year of Mba I did a job as I suffering from financial problem too so I did a job But that was in fields of marketing. When come in second year We got a option for selecting specialization so I choose finance because of my fav subject.\nI work for 1.5 years in marketing fields so last year in November I left my job and start focus on last semester exam give in Feb 2024 and got results in May 2024 with 8.9 CGPA . \n\nAfter that from June I applied for a lots of job and give interview in at least 5 mnc company but still not get job coz of my Different specialization, Don't have any skills in finance fields and also some interviewers  tell me they take from top Tier college not from Distance college I lost hope but still I decided to focus on skills also govt exams and do some internship as I have to restart from starting in finance fields. \n\nSo my advice is to don't waste time apko lagege syad ki sab ho jayga baad me lekin aap Pura sunne ke baad feel kar skte ho mere pr kya beet rhi hogi mene bhut log apko misguide karege lekin mere uper baate ko dyan se samjho ki ye galti apko or doosre ke sath nhi hone chiye apko mere advice pr bhi dyan nhi dena chiye lekin isko ek baar consider kar lo aage future my jitne aap soch rhe ho usse jada mehnat krne padegi na akele apko marks job dilwayga na akela skills na akela experience apko teeno sath lekar usme bhi top pr rhna padega . \nGood luck for Future.\n\nFor more information u can dm me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/iamritikpaswan/profilecard/?igsh=aHd4enczZjBoeXFy",
