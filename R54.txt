I will be grateful to you\n\nTLDR: After a traumatic job hunting experience and with good opportunities in EY GDS, I want to pursue a long career in this organization. I need your opinions on whether this is a good decision or what can be done better.\n\n# Details\n\n***Who am I***\n\nI am a Senior Analyst in Technical Consulting division at EY GDS India, specializing in MERN stack and have 1.5 years of experience. My previous company was a startup, where I had to learn a lot of concepts and had to work in different fields all at once. It was a good company and I left at a high note. Joined EY this month.\n\n***Joining EY***\n\nI wanted to switch to a different organization since I had been working in the startup for over an year with no promotion and benefits. My job hunting experience was extremely traumatic. No one would give a job to a 1.5 years exp guy, and I got rejected in more than 50 companies.\n\nOne day, an HR from EY called me, and in 1 week my interview and everything got scheduled, and now I have joined this organization. After that painful experience finding a job, I don't want to do that in the next 4-5 years at least.\n\n***Current Company Scenario***\n\nI work in a hybrid model and stay in my home. So no added expenses and reduced transport costs. In fact in my previous company, I even had to buy coffee and make it myself when I had to drink (the cash flow wasn't much).\n\nGood office, and I can mix well with people in professional sector, so I won't be isolated. My reporting manager, aka counsellor, is a decent guy who has technical knowledge and does his job properly. He regularly checks up on my learning progress, provides additional materials, helped me out figuring my mistakes and all.\n\nThere seems to be lots of learning opportunities, and I have already been assigned a project in a domain in which I excel. Work will start soon and I am hyped.\n\n***My Plans***\n\nSince I do not want to change anytime soon and want to utilize this company's learning resources as much as possible, I have plans to stay at least for 4-5 years. But if I stay for such a long time, then I believe I can get the badges and even apply for the Tech MBA (not sure how important it is, but it is sponsored, so...)\n\nBut applying to their MBA means I won't be able to leave the organization for a long time. So I guess I will need to stay for at least 8-9 years in the same organization. In such a scenario, I guess I will get the stamp of loyalty, although I don't know if it will come handy.\n\n***The Question***\n\nThe approach that I am taking, do you think is a good one? If I stay in a single organization for so long, I am losing the opportunity for solid increments. Keeping that in mind, do you still think it is a good decision to stay in EY for so long or shall I switch to another big 4 firm and pursue higher studies from there.\n\nI believe there is nothing as a \"good\" company. Every organization has its pros and cons. But from a salaryman's perspective with very simple ambitions (1 international tour yearly, 2 nationals) and maybe a family in the next 5 years, do you think I should stay in this org or switch to another one for higher increments?\n\nThank you once again for reading this post, and I would love to hear from your experiences.",
