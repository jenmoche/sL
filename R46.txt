Alternatively, I could negotiate a 0.5% equity stake + slight raise to stay in Dublin, but I’m unsure about long-term growth here.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. **Contractor Stigma:** If I work remotely from India as a contractor for a year, will this hurt my chances of landing a full-time role in India later?\n2. **Salary Expectations:** With 4 years of total experience (incl. research), what salary range should I target for PM/PO roles in India? \n3. **Skill Gaps:** What skills or domain expertise am I missing to be competitive in India’s PM market?\n4. **General Advice:** Any red flags in my plan? Should I push for equity/stay longer in Ireland?\n\nI’ve tried reaching out on LinkedIn but got ghosted, would really help if you can give me your honest takes. Thanks in advance!",
