I’ve done my Bachelor’s in IT, have some practical experience through internships, and I’m genuinely interested in combining my tech background with business strategy.\n\nLately, I’ve been hearing a lot of people say that UK universities only **\"teach you 20%\"** and that the remaining **80% of the course is self-taught**. That really has me questioning whether it’s worth spending over **£25,000+ on tuition alone**, not to mention the cost of living, especially when a lot of learning might come from personal effort anyway.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out is:\n\n* Is the high tuition really justified in terms of **career opportunities**, **networking**, and **practical exposure**?\n* Are there universities that provide more **hands-on learning and support**, rather than just lectures and leaving students to figure it all out?\n* Would it be smarter to choose a slightly cheaper uni in a more affordable city and rely more on self-learning + side projects?\n\nI’m not trying to cut corners—I genuinely want to learn and build a solid career. But I also want to make sure I’m making a smart investment.\n\nWould love to hear from current students, recent grads, or anyone with insights on how valuable their UK education turned out to be (especially for Business Analytics or similar fields).",

You will need an immense amount of discipline and have a self-starter mindset because you'll have a massive amount of free time. If you are looking for sponsorship in the UK, you need to try to target a Top 20 university or a specific postgraduate course at a middle ranking university that has a guaranteed placement/internship component and close ties to specific sectors (these exist at Royal Holloway, City St-Georges, and Leicester). In addition, you will need to have to target it in a sector that is in the most demand, which in this case is primarily going to be healthcare for the UK. As an international student, your prospects in 2025 and beyond are very hard but not impossible, and you will need a ton of luck and work experience to have a chance. Don't expect waltzing in the UK and getting just an MSc from Oxford, Imperial, or LSE and no work experience to speak of in the UK will guarantee you a job and sponsorship after.",

You will need an immense amount of discipline and have a self-starter mindset because you&amp;#39;ll have a massive amount of free time. If you are looking for sponsorship in the UK, you need to try to target a Top 20 university or a specific postgraduate course at a middle ranking university that has a guaranteed placement/internship component and close ties to specific sectors (these exist at Royal Holloway, City St-Georges, and Leicester). In addition, you will need to have to target it in a sector that is in the most demand, which in this case is primarily going to be healthcare for the UK. As an international student, your prospects in 2025 and beyond are very hard but not impossible, and you will need a ton of luck and work experience to have a chance. Don&amp;#39;t expect waltzing in the UK and getting just an MSc from Oxford, Imperial, or LSE and no work experience to speak of in the UK will guarantee you a job and sponsorship after.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
