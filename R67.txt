            "selftext": "I (41F) have finally summoned the courage to leave my family and for once, just live for myself. I realise it's a selfish decision and I'll be hated for it, but everyday, i suffocate in my home. \n\nI don't hate my husband (46M), he's a wonderful man- he's bright and funny, handsome, he has never been cruel or unkind to me and I have been in love with him for many years now. But he doesn't love me. He doesn't see me. I'm an extension of him, his wife, the woman he takes to parties and gatherings. The woman who is always at home, the woman who is a consumate host. The woman who loves him. \n\nMy sons (18M and 17M) are my pride and joy, I think they love me. But they haven't respected me in years. To them, I am once again, their mother who is just a housewife. I do things for them around the house, I make their food, i listen to their problems. But I don't have a fancy job, I'm not exciting, I'm just their mom and I can't remember the last time they told me they loved me or respected. I can't remember the last time my opinion was not laughed at. I know I am not an intellectual, I am just a housewife, but does that mean my opinion should be disregarded or laughed about? They elder one is in college, he barely responds to my calls and my younger one is always busy with his studies. I understand but maybe a small acknowledgement wouldn't hurt. They went from sweet children to boys who could barely tolerate me. \n\nI don't nag, my husband made it clear in the early days of our marriage, that his life and job is tough and he wants peace in the house. So I don't nag. I try to make the house as warm and loving as possible. I celebrate their birthdays with pomp, i remember every important date, every promotion, every social event. I can't remember the last time they celebrated my birthday. Our last anniversary party was 3 years ago- i wanted to go to a nice little place with my family but my husband turned it into an office promotion party + anniversary party. These are so small, I feel like an idiot, crying about my petty issues, but I don't have any other outlet. I want to talk. I want to talk to my husband, I want him to listen to me, I want him to spend time with me but I don't try anymore, he mostly ignore when I try. . Like I said, he's stressed and I told myself long ago, that home would be a place where he felt at peace. So I stay silent and smile.\n\nI do wonder if he cheats on me. He's a good man and our intimate life is still active, but he has more options. He's still handsome and charming . There are women who he respects more , pretty women with wonderful careers. I barely ever worked. I wonder if he looks at them and thinks with disgust about the leech who sits at home and doesn't match him.\n\nFor people worried that I'll take him to the cleaners, don't worry. I will leave everything, all the jewelry he ever bought me, all the money in our account. Maybe I'll take just a little, to set myself up for a while. My parents left me some money a few years ago and I invested that , so I have something on which I can fall back. My brother is going to help me buy a shop, I don't need too much, so I'll manage with whatever that gets me. Rest, I'll take only my streedhan (I'll keep some pieces aside for my future dils)  and maybe I can sell that in case of emergencies. My children and husband will have my numbers, they can call me whenever they wish, although i don't think they will. But I will leave and be by myself, my own person. I don't wish for much, but I do hope that whatever remaining years I have, they will be kind to me. \n\nI apologise for this long post filled with my petty problems and for wasting the time of those who sat and read the whole post. \n\nTL;DR: I'm leaving my family, because I feel like a piece of furniture in my own home. \n\nEDIT: I want to make sure that people realise, I do not hate my husband or children. They are my life, even now. They are not monsters, they are human and we have had so much joy in life. It was not all bad, much of it was good and I don't regret it.  I am at fault more than them. I spent my entire life making myself so small, that they couldn't see me. Even now, I have so much in my heart, that I want to say, but for years , no one listened and now I don't know how to say it. \n\nEDIT 2: I POSTED AN UPDATE SINCE THERE WERE TOO MANY COMMENTS AND MESSAGES. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL TO NOT ADDRESS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN OUT THE TIME TO WRITE. https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/s/xhgqPc4WFq",

I plan to do the same with my mother after I start earning. She is a housewife too. I am the only daughter and I am just in college (one of the best in the country, so that's a good thing for me). \n\n\nMy father does the same with her. On the surface, nothing is wrong. But he always treats her as less. I hate it, I hate him. \n\n\nI have seen my mom raise me through the years. Her life is part of the reason why I will never get married. She was never happy in her marriage. Her husband is a little piece of shit. He has done nothing except be a b*t*h to her over the years. Yes he has money, and yes he that doesn't excuse that he is a pos.\n\n\nHe treats her better now because I am his only living relative, and he knows that I wildly favour my mother. Ofcourse I will, she raised me while he was busy living his life.\n\n\nShe is a nice woman, and well, sometimes I just feel so hopeless when I see what is going on in my family.\n\n\nWhen I was young, I thought I was the only one who had such a shit home life. Then I grew up, and saw it is the same all around me. How pathetic. \n\n\nI would never want to get married because I don't want the same history repeating itself. I am right now back from college, and guess what, I wake up at 12pm. \n\n\nMy father too does on his days off sometimes. Has my mother ever done that? No. I look at things and realise how unfair they are.\n\n\nOh yes he used to behave bad with me too, that improved over the years because I am the supposedly retirement plan. \n\n\nMy mom is 46 rn. By the time I am able to do remotely something, she will be in her mid 50s. Sad that it's gonna be that long until she lives her life.\n\n\nI would still suggest you to see if you can take half of everything. Please do so. Your husband or your sons donot matter. Funny how men donot respect their housewife mother. Very pathetic of them. Donot do it out of the kindness of your heart or something, your husband doesn't get it and doesn't deserve it. Your life will be a bit better with a bit more money. At the end, whatever you choose. Just be happy. \n\n\nI too have never raised a finger around the house. I burn the pan if I make tea, but I have never disrespected my mother. She is the one picking up after me, I am grateful to her for that. Yes I am very lazy that's true.\n\n\nI would just say, just be happy. You are not the only woman who is in this situation,and yes, that is very depressing.\n\n\nI can just hope that I will turn the tables. I hope it won't be too late by then.\n\n\nA thing that randomly came to my mind, does your husband treat your sons well? Maybe that's why they are also like him now. \n\n\nLike my father used to treat me like shit and wanted to leave us penniless while he fucks around with some woman. \n\n\nBut he changed, lmao, changed? Nope, just.. let's say started pretending when I got a good college because hey, finally i changed from a burden to someone who can even donate to his lifestyle. \n\n\nI saw how he treated me and my mother poorly while my mom loved me, so I love her. Probably the only person I love. Love to me is what you do for me, not what you have with you. It's not about looks or money, it's what you do for me. It's the tea you make me when I wake up or it's the random shoulder massages.\n\n\nAfter all, my father had the money and he never loved me. My mother didn't, but she did. \n\n\nI donot know, but no, your boys are not being good sons. I know another guy whose father is the same as mine, and well, he isnt like your son. I am not blaming you at all. Just donot think \"they are young, it happens\". We are 18, and we can see through the bs our fathers put on our mothers.\n\n\nI forgot what I wanted to write. \n\n\nSo the gist is, be happy. I hope you will be very happy. Just be happy. I am so happy for you. Oneday, I hope, my mother will be happy too like this. And I can finally be at peace. I donot know how life is. Lets just say I turn the fan on full speed even in winter, even if it's freezing, just so I don't have to overheat my father talk. \n\n\nThey say life gets better. That karma exists and that...well... Tables turn. Lets see if it does for me. ",

All this must have broken your heart to what extent that you intend to leave them... \nBut at the brighter side, leaving them would be helpful in figuring out yourself, getting your identity for real.. \nN I just hope someday they all realize what they have completely lost.

I don't deserve for my children to idealise their \"cool\" father while I get called a nag for telling them to study or calling once in three days while he is in college. I am alone in my own family.

I will only tell my family after he goes to college. I have time till then to get my affairs in order. I'm not expecting kindness, I know my sons will resent me- they adore their father, he's their hero. I will be the one to blame for breaking up the family. It will be the price I pay.

I spent a long time trying to be good- a good daughter, a good daughter in law, a good wife and a good mother. Can't say it led to much in the previous two- my parents always preferred my brother over me, despite the fact that I was the one who took care of them in their final days. My in laws were typical in laws, but i spent all my time making peace with them because any conflict irritated my husband and I just wanted to create a comforting home. I don't regret my choices- I loved being his wife and a mother, there have been so many good moments /years and i would never give those up. But this also meant that someone had to give up something, and that would usually be me. My life is not completely unfulfilling, I have friends, hobbies, a comfortable life. I just want more for myself at this point and i know I'm being selfish, but it's a step I have to take.",
