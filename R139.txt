If you're a female India is even worse, there's no emphasis on women safety, police is as good as non existent, add to that a foreigner who can't communicate in local language, its not recommended at all. And currently the country is high on lack of law and order and fringe elements having free reign over the whole country. There are too many religious nutjobs, no civic sense, poverty, dirtiness and so on.\n\nI'd highly recommend to contemplate your decision, 9/10 not advisable.\n\nThat being said, India isn't all doom and gloom, the only exception is if your partner is rich and lives in those urban areas (i.e top 1%, making more than 50 LPA) which is isolated from the rest of India and they don't face any of the problems mentioned above. But if he's a middle class working professional living in your regular societies, hell no.\n\nAnd I hope you are already familiar with his parents, because we're in no shortage of conservative and highly patriarchial ones, where you have to wake up before others, prepare tea, have to dress as per their conditions, do house chores, otherwise you're labelled as a bad daughter in law.
