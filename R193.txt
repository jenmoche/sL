Being an alumnus of college, who graduated from college in 2024 (and yet to collect a minor degree, thanks to the sluggish Academic window), and someone was fortunate (or unfortunate to closely witness, and to some extent be a part of DTUSA and DSW-related affairs, I would utilize this opportunity to share some more details that you all need to be aware of, [as promised yesterday in one of my comments to related post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/comments/1jqnr3p/comment/mlc292d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).\n\nI would broadly divide this into two parts:  \nPART-1: How ABVP-DTU came into existence, and the people behind?  \nPART-2: Breaking down the demands, where the root cause (&amp; solution) lies, and what might be the actual intention.\n\nAlso, before you proceed further, I would like to go through my comment on an [unrelated reddit post on this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/s/uUmvUyh454) This will tell you a bit about the annual university budget, where it is derived from, and how the expenditures are planned on a high level. Also, it's last part related to some letters written to MoE &amp; CMO shall be relevant somewhere in the second part, when I shall be mentioning about dubious role of Siddharth Sasmal.\n\nSo let's jump on PART-1. How did ABVP-DTU came into existence?  \nThe seed was sown in 2019 by Aparendu Ram Tripathi, a 2021 passout batch student in the department of Civil Engineering. He claimed to be a *Swayamsewak* (RSS worker) and nephew of the then, now former MLA from Kushinagar, Rajnikanth Mani Tripathi.\n\n[Latest social media post by Aparendu Ram Tripathi](https://preview.redd.it/2cv4ocxn4use1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d05d30ba4c9b5b07f529011db7062f3ee3b428)\n\nTill that time, ABVP unofficially existed in DTU as no political activities were allowed. Also, Dr Yogesh, the then VC had the full support of RSS, since his Kurukshetra University days, and hence, never had to face trouble. These people were never involved in any major activities, including CR elections. At best, they used to write letter to DSW (Prof Indu) for issues like installation of a Vivekanand statue, posting some tweets related to fees hike and criticising Mamta Banerjee on the same Twitter handle.\n\nOne major point in this journey appeared in late 2022, when \"ABVP-DTU\" was registered &amp; approved as a \"society\" by DSW &amp; office of Registrar respectively (That's what makes it more hilarious &amp; unfortunate, as ABVP-DTU is now eligible to pull off funds from the fees paid by you, as, a direct component of your fees is meant for Student Welfare fund, along with placement cell and tuition fee. You exact [annual ordinance](https://dtu.ac.in/Web/Academics/ordinance/fee%20structure.pdf) to find exact proportion for your year of study).  \nThe three out of four faculty advisors of the society that I remember were Dr Di\\*\\*sh U\\*aar of the Department of Applied Mathematics (let's all him Diud or Daud/dawood bhai, as he is in the department), Professor N\\*t\\*n P\\*ri of Department of Applied Physics (let's call him Pani Puri, for being sour and watery) and Professor Pr\\*g\\*ti Kumar of Department of Electrical Engineering (lets call him Progress bhai for rapid *pragati* that he made within 2 years by becoming HoD of EE and then VC of SMVD University, Katra. Also the person I am going to talk about in next paragraph visited SMVDK last year as a university guest and proudly boasted it on his Instagram).  Dawood bhai, before coming to DTU, had served as a lecturer at Kurukshetra University till 2014-15, and came here along with Yogesh, aka RSS backing.\n\nAnother important point here is regarding the first/founding president/secretary of ABVP-DTU. He was none other than Siddharth Sasmal, a student of Department of IT, who for some reason being a native &amp; resident of Medinipur, West Bengal chose Sonipat as centre for JEE-Mains 2021 (iykyk). Siddharth's maternal grandfather Dillip Ghosh is currently national VP of BJP and former state president of West Bengal BJP. His aunt Parbati Sasmal is former member of National Commission.  \nIt is important to discuss Siddharth as he is prima-facie leader of the protest, and as apparent in videos, was the one who was speaking  shouting on Dr Prateek Sharma.\n\nNow another small part. ABVP-DTU doesn't have an Instagram page today. They used to have one. They committed mistake of posting about their first meeting in front of Pragya Bhawan, with a group photo of four POR holders, some other outsider ABVP members and faculties including Dawood and Halwa-Puri in centre. There was a long caption too, including mention of their formation, thanking chief faculty advisor Dawood, co-faculty advisors and some faculties who showed guest appearance. I and some other CRs took cognizance, wrote about this to DSW, as how was this allowed (at the same time I was struggling to get formalities of a technical society done, which was building prototypes for a DRDO competition, while these people were getting budget passed from college for their political activities....and my tech team wasn't alone....imagine technological university doing this). She had no option but to stall their activities for sometime. This came with consequences. Dawood reduced my grade from A+ to C in his course of Modern Algebra and pressurised other faculties of department to reduce my grade or fail me (this was told by one of faculties to me). One of CRs was dragged to BoD for some petty issue by Pani Puri.\n\nAlso, I have been told by some juniors that many faculties in the Department of AM were outlyingly pushing students to take part in protest.\n\nNow let's come to PART-2.  Let's talk a bit about the issues they are raising.\n\n1. Fee hike (this point is going to have detailed explanation as all other key pointers are related to finances):\n\nAs per [page 73 of JAC document](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e45823afe1e5120cec11fc4c379a0c67/uploads/2024/05/2024053065.pdf), total fees excluding hostel &amp; mess fee stands at 10.34 lakh rupees for students who are currently in 1st year. This amount was slightly above 9 lakh for me (2020-2024).  \nFor our reference, let's take fees of different colleges (JAC &amp; Non-JAC) we may aspire to compete with (for a general category student with no scholarship/waiver, for complete 4 year/5 year course):\n\n* Jadavpur University: INR 20,000 to 32,000 (including hostel)\n* JNU School of Engineering: INR 5.51 lakh for 5 year course (including hostel)\n* IGDTWU: INR 6.70 lakh (excluding hostel)\n* NSUT: INR 10.75 lakh (excluding hostel)\n* IIT Delhi: INR 13.55 lakh (excluding hostel)\n* IIIT-Hyderabad: INR 15.55 lakh (for 5 years, excluding hostel)\n* IIIT-Delhi: INR 19.55 lakh (excluding hostel)\n\nIf you have gone through [the answer that I attached earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/comments/1ilggia/comment/mbx1et6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), you might have sensed how a university plans it's revenue and receipts. Broadly for all government universities, there are three main sources of incurring revenue:\n\n1. Fees paid by students.\n2. Grants given by state/central government or UGC funds.\n3. Donations &amp; supportive remmitances from alumni.\n\nA fourth category could be non-tax revenue from university enterprises. I haven't seen any Indian university earning any, except those who have agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry related production unit.\n\nNow, last year, if you have gone through my quoted answer, out of 268 crore annual university budget, only 41 crore was through the allocated grants from state government. In this years budget, presented by Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, last month, this amount has been increased to 42 crore (0.06% increase only, though inflation rate is above 5.5%). [News link attached here](https://bestcolleges.indiatoday.in/news-detail/delhi-govt-announces-cm-shri-schools-and-major-education-reforms-in-budget)\n\nThe only way to meet expenditures, while not hiking the fees or increasing number of students is to get allocated higher funds from the state expendiuture.\n\nNow those who were chanting *DTU VC haye-haye* should first tell where is this number going to come from?\n\nSince, the trends of sudden fees hike has been almost universal pan India in past decade, let me point down some policy shifts by Modi government:\n\n* Reduction in UGC &amp; AICTE grants by over 60%. \\[[Reference Link](https://prsindia.org/budgets/parliament/demand-for-grants-2024-25-analysis-education), [Economic Times Article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/interim-budget-2024-25-ugc-faces-over-60-pc-cut-budget-for-school-education-increased/articleshow/107330722.cms)\\]\n* In 2017, the Indian government formed HEFA (Higher Education Funding Agency). You can clearly read about it on it's [website](https://hefa.co.in/). Nicknamed as 'HEFA policy' it clearly aims to push universities from withdrawing from government budget, and rely on corporate banks to it's funding. Also, in clear terms, it lopsidedly favours IITs &amp; AIIMS' over other central &amp; state universities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai557xb4vyse1.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51430fce26ad14b19bb88e002e1fe3b9fde9b93a\n\n* By F.Y. 2022-23, the central government drastically started pushing HEFA policy and phased out old system of higher educational grants. This is going to intensify further under New Education Policy, 2020, as UGC &amp; AICTE shall be gradually replaced by Higher Education Commission of India (HECI)\n* Alas, we are a state university, and state governments in India follow central governments a bit late. Imagine what would have happened till now, had we been DCE only? Reminds me of recent downfall of Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh (contrary to name, it is a centrally funded institution).\n* On 12th February 2018, UGC introduced a scheme to provide \"autonomy\" to universities having NAAC index &gt; 3.5 to introduce new courses, but, \"self-finance\" them. In practical terms, with respect to DTU, we have seen all departments introducing courses in past 2-3 years like Machine Learning, AI, Pattern Recognition, IoT, etc. But since the budget allotted to them should not come up from expense of budget provided by government, the university either needs to increase fees, bring in guest faculties or a combination of both (which we have seen lately happening in huge amount).\n\nIn simpler words, the union government has been doing gradual and sometimes sudden policy shifts to phase out conventional state funding and rely more on private investors and banks, which effectively means, universities will simply increase fees and students will need to rely more on student loan. This is also reflected in decisions like stopping exams like NTSE &amp; KVPY, while increasing trends of loan based/loan linked schemes by government.\n\nNow if ABVP-DTU guys, including Siddharth Sasmal, Ajay Dahiya and Nitesh Mahala wish to stop fee hike, they should go to 6A, Deen Dayal Marg (their own HQ) instead of causing havoc with saffron flags in hand and posting about it on Instagram (here I would request community moderators to not to flag this, as they wish to be named publicly for their aspirations to become a mainstream politician, infact they have put forward their names to local newspapers themselves). Though I understand these things are above the mental intellect of Nitesh &amp; Ajay. It's written on their face &amp; JEE rank (cough-cough).\n\n2. \"New grading policy\"  \nWell this is the new grading policy they are shouting about:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orr7pchh0zse1.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073311d9892b349c4b10fdbfe7866577d6ce65cc\n\nIt simply tries to ensure that someone doesn't pass solely on basis on internal grading, and also reduces the total marks to pass to 35 from 40.  \nIt used to be in place earlier too, with total marks including CWS at 40. It was removed in Yogesh era to cater needs of ultra-reserved candidates who were having too much difficulty in moving beyond 2nd year.  \nThe current policy reduces the faculty's privilege to fail you or pass you solely through dominant component of rather arbitrary internal marks and also stops charlatans to simply rely on internal marks.\n\nWhy is this a problem? I leave this all to your intellect.\n\n3. Hike in backlog and make-up examination fee.  \nThe extra-ordinary hike is for summer semester only. For make-up examination, it's understood, as a lot of departments were facing complaint of \"False-Postives\" asking for make up examination.\n\n4. Re-opening of \"main canteen\" (MechC).                                                                                          Seriously, do you need it after having that food court in/around Raj Soin, and a cafeteria in Pragya Bhawan?\n\n5. Opening of \"back gate\"                                                                                                                        Seems Siddharth is having too much love for his Bangladeshi immigrant brothers living in illegal colonies on back side of our college.\n\n6. Downgrading quality of teaching in classes.\n\nHmm, important issue.  \nThis is mostly due to over-reliance on guest faculties, mostly recruited under JP Saini's time, all from UP based local colleges. He himself is alumni of a Raebariely based college under Gorakhpur University (and his friend who is currently HOD of IT Department &amp; Head of Hostels).  \nWhy is this happening?  \nPan India issue due to policy shifts I stated under point-1. All new courses are being taught by these guest faculties.  \nIn addition to financial constraints &amp; policy bottleneck to promote appointment of guest lecturers, there is another issue under New Education Policy which over-emphasizes of Gross Enrollment ratio (1 faculty per 15 students or so). TBH, we don't need these many faculties. Students are happy sitting in large lecture halls rather than being disturbed for petty issues in name of discipline.  \nThe other problem with guest faculties remain that they need not to pass same thresholds as a permanent faculty, i.e., they don't need to clear exams like UGC-NET &amp; JRF. Also, selections are done by panel of HOD &amp; some professors of department. That's where most of corruption and political pressures (*sifarish)* comes in.  \nAlso, guest faculties aren't paid much. They are treated as second class citizens. They aren't allowed to take part in formal research, by default, until not permitted by the Dean, Academics. As a result, the quality candidates are either moving out of India at higher percentage or looking for better jobs in other sectors.\n\nIn the same respective regards of teaching, another issue remains with curriculum. The Choice Based Credit Sytem (CBCS) was imposed on all state and central government universities in 2018. While it brought some welcoming changes like provision of minors and electives, it also standardised curriculum across all universities till 80% for each subject and gave a model format of grading. That also means that university administration cannot bring radical changes to adapt as per industry standards &amp; requirements on it's own even if it wishes to.\n\n7. ERP, administration, etc.  \nWell I am no more an user of ERP, so I cannot comment. The juniors might have moved towards Saarthi portal. The legacy ERP portal was maintained by LibSys limited, a private contractor.\n\nThe administration? It sucks, but albeit saw marginal improvements under current Vice-Chancellor.  \nThe problem with administration remains that they don't want to plan and work as per productivity of a student. Everything is designed as per their 10AM to 4PM with 1PM-2PM lunch break. The state of affairs is so sad, that we were not given degree on stage, and had to line up horribly in front of academics window. Why? Because staff cannot stay after 04:00PM.\n\nI will write about an achievable &amp; pragmatic solution to such issues towards end. Though that shall need huge will, and many boomer professors will loose advantage. Hence, they shall sponsor such protests more as they are doing right now.\n\nNow, as you may see a lot of problems are relate to policy shifts that has been going on at level of central government since 2017-18. The faculties, including likes of Dawood Bhai and Paani Puri understand these points much better than me. But why they are pushing the protests now all of sudden?  \nThese people were completely silent during JP Saini era. Infact, as I stated in my previous answer that has been attached twice above, the concerned Bengali ABVP-DTU leader was even scared to show up to give his signatures on letters \"we\" used to write to Hon'ble Lt Governer, Chief Minister Office and Directorate of Technical Education.\n\nInfact, when Dr. Prateek Sharma joined 12 months ago, he brought in rapid changes to student amenities, be it about opening new cafeteria, bringing photocopy shop back to campus, bringing mother dairy inside campus, etc.. He used to come to hostel and department labs without prior information, contrary to last two VCs, who's PS would inform concerned department staff two weeks prior, and everything would be tip-top on day of his visit, and he would find it all satisfactory. Training &amp; Placement cell too saw a jump in it's accountability &amp; transparency, be it in terms of showing figures categorically in FTE, Intern, Intern + PPO, etc. Last year, everyone who was given an internship of any form was counted as placed. Many deans and heads who were sitting on positions beyond completion of their tenure and merit, were removed. Much coveted post of TnP head and Dean, Academics are the prime example.\n\nSo why all of sudden, they are protesting now (with a set of faculties promoting protests)? Few reasons:\n\n* The senior faculties are frustrated. Dr Prateek made Biometric attendance mandatory for all senior professors, including HODs. Most of HODs including that of ABVP-DTU's leader's department never used to be on time and remained infrequently present in office.\n* During JP Saini's time many OBC faculties were given undue promotions. Sharma ji started changing that back to normal.\n* Faculty advisor Dawood bhai is facing problems with Department of AM after Sharma ji removed SPS from HoD post. Dawood bhai isn't at helm of department affairs anymore. He shouldn't be either. At the best, he is just an associate professor.\n* Poltics at play: Prof Yogesh and Dr JP Saini had roots in RSS, whereas, Dr Prateek Sharma was appointed through lobbying by Atishi. TBH, Dr Prateek holds more merit for being alumnus of DCE-1989 batch. Whereas Yogesh wasn't even from technical background. If you look at tonality of protestors carefully, all of it was about hurling slogans against Vice Chancellor. This is a protest backed by other lobby. Otherwise, the person who was never able to show courage enough to give a signature on a letter till few months ago is now shouting abuses to VC.\n\nComing back to key issue related to college administration that could be solved through pragmatic ways:\n\n* Publish all office orders &amp; MoMs, including the developments in office of registrar, on DTU website on daily basis. What's the need of hiding them and making concerned people walk to corridors of admin block, and in end let them file a RTI? There is no point in keeping information classified related to expenditures, be it related to some renovation or a society taking reimbursement for some event. We aren't building missiles for Indian military here in the campus. This will promote accountability, right decision making and confidence.\n* Also, why I am keeping society expenditures in centre here? Because, there is a lot of corruption going on here. I myself did scam of 6 lakh INR in my third year, by showing expenses higher than incurred. Why? Number 1, faculty advisors and DSW won't approve small amounts easily. I had too walk to admin for weeks to get approved 40k worth of expenditure for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) for genuine expenses of building prototype than hospitality related bills in TechFest &amp; CulturalFest. Infact, the amount of money that DSW &amp; registrar alone digests from EngiFest &amp; Invictus is way beyond than a common student's imagination. Number 2, half of scam amount I generated went to faculty's and DSW's pocket. Had I not done that, team would never have been able to save much to go to that dream hackathon. The problem here remains that as a person sitting on POR like Treasurer, Secretary or President, your value in eye of others is decided on basis of how much scam could you do to throw that after party. As a result, a lot of people end up wasting their precious time in college.\n* Fire DSW &amp; Registrar from their position, and give them farewell. They have been in such positions since 2018. It's been 7 years now. Before that, at least since 2008/09, they have been in different administrative positions. Their age has crossed retirement age already. They are two key reasons, this university saw sluggish progress, and held too much of autonomy In last days of Yogesh and JP Saini's days.\n* Build a single window portal (if possible shift it to Web3 based stack) with distributed computing based servers for all issues related to administration, be it about collecting a report card, or getting an appointment with a professor or dean. This will reduce the element of serendipity, time wastages for petty issues and improve productivity.\n* The desired portal should be made open source, instead of being outsourced to some third party IT service provider.\n* The key positions of Deans should be diversified with respect to departments. No special officer/head/dean should remain in position beyond their fixed tenure, and they should be strictly sent back to take up academic and research. Also, age bar should be reduced to take up such positions. Young assistant professors should be given representation. Currently, the whole setup is designed in such a manner that faculty simply waits to be senior enough to take that position. People spend 10-15 years of career in administrative roles, and academic roles are kept lying on backfoot.\n* For TnP department: Reduce dependency on student placement coordinators. Hire 5-10 recruitment specialists and introduce a PoR of \"assistant placement coordinator\" for third year students, so that they could focus more on bringing internships, and could have a full exposure much earlier. Democratizing the process is necessary. Reduce weightage of department faculty's opinion during Placement Coordinator interview.\n* For classroom teaching: Make it necessary for all faculties to provide standardized question banks and typed notes well in advanced when the course or chapter begins (like IITs and Ivy Leagues do). If someone is able to compensate for classroom times in a productive activity with proof (it could be as small as solving leetcode questions), waive off attendance for him/her. Build an online lecture and time efficient tutorial platform for all subjects (even that Pakistani university, LUMS is having one with professors uploading quality lecture on YouTube).\n* Build unity with other JAC colleges, and start lobbying to get the university away from AICTE, on patterns of IITs and IISc. AICTE is a corrupt body in itself, whose purpose is to regulate local colleges for the right reasons. We still survived for long, but now, by design of NEP &amp; HECI, as stated in explanation pointers below 1st demand above by me, it is going to get worsen for university and it shall be nearer to the tipping point, from where it slips away to chasm permanently. College will simply need to increase student intake, all with loans on head, to run it's finances.\n\nUltimately, the whole demands and solutions above are deep rooted in \"student productivity\". Everything should be determined keeping student's productivity in mind, rather than outdated norms. It used to work fine till there were enough jobs in the market, to give every jack a placement. I remember, in 2020, I saw the then seniors getting placed even with backlogs, and then we saw 2024, a complete drought. When you need to beat the shit out of competition, you need productivity.\n\nAs far as the protestors are concerned, their leader is just a nepotist who is here to earn brownie points for his political career. Evidence is clear that he barely cares about real solution. Had he cared about real solution, he would have actually protested against central government's policies first of all.\n\nSitting on protest earlier would have meant lathicharge from guards and an year back. Thanks to Dr. Prateek who actually is willing to listen to students from day 1.  \nKeep in mind that the VC is a huge post in the constitutional hierarchical framework. Within campus premises, he is next to Governor of the state or Vice-President of India in state and central universities respectively. ",

Being an alumnus of college, who graduated from college in 2024 (and yet to collect a minor degree, thanks to the sluggish Academic window), and someone was fortunate (or unfortunate to closely witness, and to some extent be a part of DTUSA and DSW-related affairs, I would utilize this opportunity to share some more details that you all need to be aware of, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/comments/1jqnr3p/comment/mlc292d/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;as promised yesterday in one of my comments to related post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would broadly divide this into two parts:&lt;br/&gt;\nPART-1: How ABVP-DTU came into existence, and the people behind?&lt;br/&gt;\nPART-2: Breaking down the demands, where the root cause (&amp;amp; solution) lies, and what might be the actual intention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, before you proceed further, I would like to go through my comment on an &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/s/uUmvUyh454\"&gt;unrelated reddit post on this link.&lt;/a&gt; This will tell you a bit about the annual university budget, where it is derived from, and how the expenditures are planned on a high level. Also, it&amp;#39;s last part related to some letters written to MoE &amp;amp; CMO shall be relevant somewhere in the second part, when I shall be mentioning about dubious role of Siddharth Sasmal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s jump on PART-1. How did ABVP-DTU came into existence?&lt;br/&gt;\nThe seed was sown in 2019 by Aparendu Ram Tripathi, a 2021 passout batch student in the department of Civil Engineering. He claimed to be a &lt;em&gt;Swayamsewak&lt;/em&gt; (RSS worker) and nephew of the then, now former MLA from Kushinagar, Rajnikanth Mani Tripathi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2cv4ocxn4use1.png?width=680&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f0d05d30ba4c9b5b07f529011db7062f3ee3b428\"&gt;Latest social media post by Aparendu Ram Tripathi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Till that time, ABVP unofficially existed in DTU as no political activities were allowed. Also, Dr Yogesh, the then VC had the full support of RSS, since his Kurukshetra University days, and hence, never had to face trouble. These people were never involved in any major activities, including CR elections. At best, they used to write letter to DSW (Prof Indu) for issues like installation of a Vivekanand statue, posting some tweets related to fees hike and criticising Mamta Banerjee on the same Twitter handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One major point in this journey appeared in late 2022, when &amp;quot;ABVP-DTU&amp;quot; was registered &amp;amp; approved as a &amp;quot;society&amp;quot; by DSW &amp;amp; office of Registrar respectively (That&amp;#39;s what makes it more hilarious &amp;amp; unfortunate, as ABVP-DTU is now eligible to pull off funds from the fees paid by you, as, a direct component of your fees is meant for Student Welfare fund, along with placement cell and tuition fee. You exact &lt;a href=\"https://dtu.ac.in/Web/Academics/ordinance/fee%20structure.pdf\"&gt;annual ordinance&lt;/a&gt; to find exact proportion for your year of study).&lt;br/&gt;\nThe three out of four faculty advisors of the society that I remember were Dr Di**sh U*aar of the Department of Applied Mathematics (let&amp;#39;s all him Diud or Daud/dawood bhai, as he is in the department), Professor N*t*n P*ri of Department of Applied Physics (let&amp;#39;s call him Pani Puri, for being sour and watery) and Professor Pr*g*ti Kumar of Department of Electrical Engineering (lets call him Progress bhai for rapid &lt;em&gt;pragati&lt;/em&gt; that he made within 2 years by becoming HoD of EE and then VC of SMVD University, Katra. Also the person I am going to talk about in next paragraph visited SMVDK last year as a university guest and proudly boasted it on his Instagram).  Dawood bhai, before coming to DTU, had served as a lecturer at Kurukshetra University till 2014-15, and came here along with Yogesh, aka RSS backing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another important point here is regarding the first/founding president/secretary of ABVP-DTU. He was none other than Siddharth Sasmal, a student of Department of IT, who for some reason being a native &amp;amp; resident of Medinipur, West Bengal chose Sonipat as centre for JEE-Mains 2021 (iykyk). Siddharth&amp;#39;s maternal grandfather Dillip Ghosh is currently national VP of BJP and former state president of West Bengal BJP. His aunt Parbati Sasmal is former member of National Commission.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt is important to discuss Siddharth as he is prima-facie leader of the protest, and as apparent in videos, was the one who was speaking  shouting on Dr Prateek Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now another small part. ABVP-DTU doesn&amp;#39;t have an Instagram page today. They used to have one. They committed mistake of posting about their first meeting in front of Pragya Bhawan, with a group photo of four POR holders, some other outsider ABVP members and faculties including Dawood and Halwa-Puri in centre. There was a long caption too, including mention of their formation, thanking chief faculty advisor Dawood, co-faculty advisors and some faculties who showed guest appearance. I and some other CRs took cognizance, wrote about this to DSW, as how was this allowed (at the same time I was struggling to get formalities of a technical society done, which was building prototypes for a DRDO competition, while these people were getting budget passed from college for their political activities....and my tech team wasn&amp;#39;t alone....imagine technological university doing this). She had no option but to stall their activities for sometime. This came with consequences. Dawood reduced my grade from A+ to C in his course of Modern Algebra and pressurised other faculties of department to reduce my grade or fail me (this was told by one of faculties to me). One of CRs was dragged to BoD for some petty issue by Pani Puri.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I have been told by some juniors that many faculties in the Department of AM were outlyingly pushing students to take part in protest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s come to PART-2.  Let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about the issues they are raising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fee hike (this point is going to have detailed explanation as all other key pointers are related to finances):&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href=\"https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3e45823afe1e5120cec11fc4c379a0c67/uploads/2024/05/2024053065.pdf\"&gt;page 73 of JAC document&lt;/a&gt;, total fees excluding hostel &amp;amp; mess fee stands at 10.34 lakh rupees for students who are currently in 1st year. This amount was slightly above 9 lakh for me (2020-2024).&lt;br/&gt;\nFor our reference, let&amp;#39;s take fees of different colleges (JAC &amp;amp; Non-JAC) we may aspire to compete with (for a general category student with no scholarship/waiver, for complete 4 year/5 year course):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jadavpur University: INR 20,000 to 32,000 (including hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;JNU School of Engineering: INR 5.51 lakh for 5 year course (including hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IGDTWU: INR 6.70 lakh (excluding hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NSUT: INR 10.75 lakh (excluding hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IIT Delhi: INR 13.55 lakh (excluding hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IIIT-Hyderabad: INR 15.55 lakh (for 5 years, excluding hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IIIT-Delhi: INR 19.55 lakh (excluding hostel)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have gone through &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU__Delhi/comments/1ilggia/comment/mbx1et6/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;the answer that I attached earlier&lt;/a&gt;, you might have sensed how a university plans it&amp;#39;s revenue and receipts. Broadly for all government universities, there are three main sources of incurring revenue:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fees paid by students.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Grants given by state/central government or UGC funds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Donations &amp;amp; supportive remmitances from alumni.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fourth category could be non-tax revenue from university enterprises. I haven&amp;#39;t seen any Indian university earning any, except those who have agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry related production unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, last year, if you have gone through my quoted answer, out of 268 crore annual university budget, only 41 crore was through the allocated grants from state government. In this years budget, presented by Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, last month, this amount has been increased to 42 crore (0.06% increase only, though inflation rate is above 5.5%). &lt;a href=\"https://bestcolleges.indiatoday.in/news-detail/delhi-govt-announces-cm-shri-schools-and-major-education-reforms-in-budget\"&gt;News link attached here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way to meet expenditures, while not hiking the fees or increasing number of students is to get allocated higher funds from the state expendiuture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now those who were chanting &lt;em&gt;DTU VC haye-haye&lt;/em&gt; should first tell where is this number going to come from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since, the trends of sudden fees hike has been almost universal pan India in past decade, let me point down some policy shifts by Modi government:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduction in UGC &amp;amp; AICTE grants by over 60%. [&lt;a href=\"https://prsindia.org/budgets/parliament/demand-for-grants-2024-25-analysis-education\"&gt;Reference Link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/interim-budget-2024-25-ugc-faces-over-60-pc-cut-budget-for-school-education-increased/articleshow/107330722.cms\"&gt;Economic Times Article&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In 2017, the Indian government formed HEFA (Higher Education Funding Agency). You can clearly read about it on it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://hefa.co.in/\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Nicknamed as &amp;#39;HEFA policy&amp;#39; it clearly aims to push universities from withdrawing from government budget, and rely on corporate banks to it&amp;#39;s funding. Also, in clear terms, it lopsidedly favours IITs &amp;amp; AIIMS&amp;#39; over other central &amp;amp; state universities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ai557xb4vyse1.png?width=1436&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51430fce26ad14b19bb88e002e1fe3b9fde9b93a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ai557xb4vyse1.png?width=1436&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51430fce26ad14b19bb88e002e1fe3b9fde9b93a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;By F.Y. 2022-23, the central government drastically started pushing HEFA policy and phased out old system of higher educational grants. This is going to intensify further under New Education Policy, 2020, as UGC &amp;amp; AICTE shall be gradually replaced by Higher Education Commission of India (HECI)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alas, we are a state university, and state governments in India follow central governments a bit late. Imagine what would have happened till now, had we been DCE only? Reminds me of recent downfall of Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh (contrary to name, it is a centrally funded institution).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On 12th February 2018, UGC introduced a scheme to provide &amp;quot;autonomy&amp;quot; to universities having NAAC index &amp;gt; 3.5 to introduce new courses, but, &amp;quot;self-finance&amp;quot; them. In practical terms, with respect to DTU, we have seen all departments introducing courses in past 2-3 years like Machine Learning, AI, Pattern Recognition, IoT, etc. But since the budget allotted to them should not come up from expense of budget provided by government, the university either needs to increase fees, bring in guest faculties or a combination of both (which we have seen lately happening in huge amount).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In simpler words, the union government has been doing gradual and sometimes sudden policy shifts to phase out conventional state funding and rely more on private investors and banks, which effectively means, universities will simply increase fees and students will need to rely more on student loan. This is also reflected in decisions like stopping exams like NTSE &amp;amp; KVPY, while increasing trends of loan based/loan linked schemes by government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if ABVP-DTU guys, including Siddharth Sasmal, Ajay Dahiya and Nitesh Mahala wish to stop fee hike, they should go to 6A, Deen Dayal Marg (their own HQ) instead of causing havoc with saffron flags in hand and posting about it on Instagram (here I would request community moderators to not to flag this, as they wish to be named publicly for their aspirations to become a mainstream politician, infact they have put forward their names to local newspapers themselves). Though I understand these things are above the mental intellect of Nitesh &amp;amp; Ajay. It&amp;#39;s written on their face &amp;amp; JEE rank (cough-cough).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;New grading policy&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nWell this is the new grading policy they are shouting about:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/orr7pchh0zse1.png?width=711&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=073311d9892b349c4b10fdbfe7866577d6ce65cc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/orr7pchh0zse1.png?width=711&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=073311d9892b349c4b10fdbfe7866577d6ce65cc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It simply tries to ensure that someone doesn&amp;#39;t pass solely on basis on internal grading, and also reduces the total marks to pass to 35 from 40.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt used to be in place earlier too, with total marks including CWS at 40. It was removed in Yogesh era to cater needs of ultra-reserved candidates who were having too much difficulty in moving beyond 2nd year.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe current policy reduces the faculty&amp;#39;s privilege to fail you or pass you solely through dominant component of rather arbitrary internal marks and also stops charlatans to simply rely on internal marks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this a problem? I leave this all to your intellect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hike in backlog and make-up examination fee.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe extra-ordinary hike is for summer semester only. For make-up examination, it&amp;#39;s understood, as a lot of departments were facing complaint of &amp;quot;False-Postives&amp;quot; asking for make up examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-opening of &amp;quot;main canteen&amp;quot; (MechC).                                                                                          Seriously, do you need it after having that food court in/around Raj Soin, and a cafeteria in Pragya Bhawan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening of &amp;quot;back gate&amp;quot;                                                                                                                        Seems Siddharth is having too much love for his Bangladeshi immigrant brothers living in illegal colonies on back side of our college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downgrading quality of teaching in classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm, important issue.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is mostly due to over-reliance on guest faculties, mostly recruited under JP Saini&amp;#39;s time, all from UP based local colleges. He himself is alumni of a Raebariely based college under Gorakhpur University (and his friend who is currently HOD of IT Department &amp;amp; Head of Hostels).&lt;br/&gt;\nWhy is this happening?&lt;br/&gt;\nPan India issue due to policy shifts I stated under point-1. All new courses are being taught by these guest faculties.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn addition to financial constraints &amp;amp; policy bottleneck to promote appointment of guest lecturers, there is another issue under New Education Policy which over-emphasizes of Gross Enrollment ratio (1 faculty per 15 students or so). TBH, we don&amp;#39;t need these many faculties. Students are happy sitting in large lecture halls rather than being disturbed for petty issues in name of discipline.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe other problem with guest faculties remain that they need not to pass same thresholds as a permanent faculty, i.e., they don&amp;#39;t need to clear exams like UGC-NET &amp;amp; JRF. Also, selections are done by panel of HOD &amp;amp; some professors of department. That&amp;#39;s where most of corruption and political pressures (&lt;em&gt;sifarish)&lt;/em&gt; comes in.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso, guest faculties aren&amp;#39;t paid much. They are treated as second class citizens. They aren&amp;#39;t allowed to take part in formal research, by default, until not permitted by the Dean, Academics. As a result, the quality candidates are either moving out of India at higher percentage or looking for better jobs in other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the same respective regards of teaching, another issue remains with curriculum. The Choice Based Credit Sytem (CBCS) was imposed on all state and central government universities in 2018. While it brought some welcoming changes like provision of minors and electives, it also standardised curriculum across all universities till 80% for each subject and gave a model format of grading. That also means that university administration cannot bring radical changes to adapt as per industry standards &amp;amp; requirements on it&amp;#39;s own even if it wishes to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ERP, administration, etc.&lt;br/&gt;\nWell I am no more an user of ERP, so I cannot comment. The juniors might have moved towards Saarthi portal. The legacy ERP portal was maintained by LibSys limited, a private contractor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The administration? It sucks, but albeit saw marginal improvements under current Vice-Chancellor.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe problem with administration remains that they don&amp;#39;t want to plan and work as per productivity of a student. Everything is designed as per their 10AM to 4PM with 1PM-2PM lunch break. The state of affairs is so sad, that we were not given degree on stage, and had to line up horribly in front of academics window. Why? Because staff cannot stay after 04:00PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will write about an achievable &amp;amp; pragmatic solution to such issues towards end. Though that shall need huge will, and many boomer professors will loose advantage. Hence, they shall sponsor such protests more as they are doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as you may see a lot of problems are relate to policy shifts that has been going on at level of central government since 2017-18. The faculties, including likes of Dawood Bhai and Paani Puri understand these points much better than me. But why they are pushing the protests now all of sudden?&lt;br/&gt;\nThese people were completely silent during JP Saini era. Infact, as I stated in my previous answer that has been attached twice above, the concerned Bengali ABVP-DTU leader was even scared to show up to give his signatures on letters &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; used to write to Hon&amp;#39;ble Lt Governer, Chief Minister Office and Directorate of Technical Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Infact, when Dr. Prateek Sharma joined 12 months ago, he brought in rapid changes to student amenities, be it about opening new cafeteria, bringing photocopy shop back to campus, bringing mother dairy inside campus, etc.. He used to come to hostel and department labs without prior information, contrary to last two VCs, who&amp;#39;s PS would inform concerned department staff two weeks prior, and everything would be tip-top on day of his visit, and he would find it all satisfactory. Training &amp;amp; Placement cell too saw a jump in it&amp;#39;s accountability &amp;amp; transparency, be it in terms of showing figures categorically in FTE, Intern, Intern + PPO, etc. Last year, everyone who was given an internship of any form was counted as placed. Many deans and heads who were sitting on positions beyond completion of their tenure and merit, were removed. Much coveted post of TnP head and Dean, Academics are the prime example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why all of sudden, they are protesting now (with a set of faculties promoting protests)? Few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The senior faculties are frustrated. Dr Prateek made Biometric attendance mandatory for all senior professors, including HODs. Most of HODs including that of ABVP-DTU&amp;#39;s leader&amp;#39;s department never used to be on time and remained infrequently present in office.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During JP Saini&amp;#39;s time many OBC faculties were given undue promotions. Sharma ji started changing that back to normal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Faculty advisor Dawood bhai is facing problems with Department of AM after Sharma ji removed SPS from HoD post. Dawood bhai isn&amp;#39;t at helm of department affairs anymore. He shouldn&amp;#39;t be either. At the best, he is just an associate professor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Poltics at play: Prof Yogesh and Dr JP Saini had roots in RSS, whereas, Dr Prateek Sharma was appointed through lobbying by Atishi. TBH, Dr Prateek holds more merit for being alumnus of DCE-1989 batch. Whereas Yogesh wasn&amp;#39;t even from technical background. If you look at tonality of protestors carefully, all of it was about hurling slogans against Vice Chancellor. This is a protest backed by other lobby. Otherwise, the person who was never able to show courage enough to give a signature on a letter till few months ago is now shouting abuses to VC.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming back to key issue related to college administration that could be solved through pragmatic ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Publish all office orders &amp;amp; MoMs, including the developments in office of registrar, on DTU website on daily basis. What&amp;#39;s the need of hiding them and making concerned people walk to corridors of admin block, and in end let them file a RTI? There is no point in keeping information classified related to expenditures, be it related to some renovation or a society taking reimbursement for some event. We aren&amp;#39;t building missiles for Indian military here in the campus. This will promote accountability, right decision making and confidence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also, why I am keeping society expenditures in centre here? Because, there is a lot of corruption going on here. I myself did scam of 6 lakh INR in my third year, by showing expenses higher than incurred. Why? Number 1, faculty advisors and DSW won&amp;#39;t approve small amounts easily. I had too walk to admin for weeks to get approved 40k worth of expenditure for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) for genuine expenses of building prototype than hospitality related bills in TechFest &amp;amp; CulturalFest. Infact, the amount of money that DSW &amp;amp; registrar alone digests from EngiFest &amp;amp; Invictus is way beyond than a common student&amp;#39;s imagination. Number 2, half of scam amount I generated went to faculty&amp;#39;s and DSW&amp;#39;s pocket. Had I not done that, team would never have been able to save much to go to that dream hackathon. The problem here remains that as a person sitting on POR like Treasurer, Secretary or President, your value in eye of others is decided on basis of how much scam could you do to throw that after party. As a result, a lot of people end up wasting their precious time in college.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fire DSW &amp;amp; Registrar from their position, and give them farewell. They have been in such positions since 2018. It&amp;#39;s been 7 years now. Before that, at least since 2008/09, they have been in different administrative positions. Their age has crossed retirement age already. They are two key reasons, this university saw sluggish progress, and held too much of autonomy In last days of Yogesh and JP Saini&amp;#39;s days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build a single window portal (if possible shift it to Web3 based stack) with distributed computing based servers for all issues related to administration, be it about collecting a report card, or getting an appointment with a professor or dean. This will reduce the element of serendipity, time wastages for petty issues and improve productivity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The desired portal should be made open source, instead of being outsourced to some third party IT service provider.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The key positions of Deans should be diversified with respect to departments. No special officer/head/dean should remain in position beyond their fixed tenure, and they should be strictly sent back to take up academic and research. Also, age bar should be reduced to take up such positions. Young assistant professors should be given representation. Currently, the whole setup is designed in such a manner that faculty simply waits to be senior enough to take that position. People spend 10-15 years of career in administrative roles, and academic roles are kept lying on backfoot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For TnP department: Reduce dependency on student placement coordinators. Hire 5-10 recruitment specialists and introduce a PoR of &amp;quot;assistant placement coordinator&amp;quot; for third year students, so that they could focus more on bringing internships, and could have a full exposure much earlier. Democratizing the process is necessary. Reduce weightage of department faculty&amp;#39;s opinion during Placement Coordinator interview.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For classroom teaching: Make it necessary for all faculties to provide standardized question banks and typed notes well in advanced when the course or chapter begins (like IITs and Ivy Leagues do). If someone is able to compensate for classroom times in a productive activity with proof (it could be as small as solving leetcode questions), waive off attendance for him/her. Build an online lecture and time efficient tutorial platform for all subjects (even that Pakistani university, LUMS is having one with professors uploading quality lecture on YouTube).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build unity with other JAC colleges, and start lobbying to get the university away from AICTE, on patterns of IITs and IISc. AICTE is a corrupt body in itself, whose purpose is to regulate local colleges for the right reasons. We still survived for long, but now, by design of NEP &amp;amp; HECI, as stated in explanation pointers below 1st demand above by me, it is going to get worsen for university and it shall be nearer to the tipping point, from where it slips away to chasm permanently. College will simply need to increase student intake, all with loans on head, to run it&amp;#39;s finances.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the whole demands and solutions above are deep rooted in &amp;quot;student productivity&amp;quot;. Everything should be determined keeping student&amp;#39;s productivity in mind, rather than outdated norms. It used to work fine till there were enough jobs in the market, to give every jack a placement. I remember, in 2020, I saw the then seniors getting placed even with backlogs, and then we saw 2024, a complete drought. When you need to beat the shit out of competition, you need productivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as the protestors are concerned, their leader is just a nepotist who is here to earn brownie points for his political career. Evidence is clear that he barely cares about real solution. Had he cared about real solution, he would have actually protested against central government&amp;#39;s policies first of all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting on protest earlier would have meant lathicharge from guards and an year back. Thanks to Dr. Prateek who actually is willing to listen to students from day 1.&lt;br/&gt;\nKeep in mind that the VC is a huge post in the constitutional hierarchical framework. Within campus premises, he is next to Governor of the state or Vice-President of India in state and central universities respectively. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
