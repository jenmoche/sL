My first one is 5 year old, and the second one is 6months old. \nI was planning on getting a remote job in India (Mumbai). I am into front end development. But my husband believes it will be difficult for us to manage 2 kids, and asks me to take a career break. he will be gone 9-5 for his work, so I have to rely on house helps. My in-laws are aged and won't be able to help much. Is there any one here working with 2 kids in Mumbai? I would like to get some insights on how does every day looks like for you guys. \n\nThanks in advance. \n",

We both have flex work from home schedule and hire a baby sitter on some occasions for a couple of hours as needed. We have no family help nearby and never had even with the first born. We both have hectic full time jobs but are able to figure out a system. If one of us had to go to the office 40 hours a week then we would get hired help (nanny or day care) too. My point is: in India you can hire more help even for cooking, cleaning etc which you can’t in the US easily so I don’t see why giving up your career is needed if you don’t want to do it.",

We both have flex work from home schedule and hire a baby sitter on some occasions for a couple of hours as needed. We have no family help nearby and never had even with the first born. We both have hectic full time jobs but are able to figure out a system. If one of us had to go to the office 40 hours a week then we would get hired help (nanny or day care) too. My point is: in India you can hire more help even for cooking, cleaning etc which you can’t in the US easily so I don’t see why giving up your career is needed if you don’t want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Technically you could manage to WFH and have a nanny/ house help around to help with your kids but depends on your workload/ childcare expectations/ professional goals etc. \n\nAdding some personal context FWIW - \n\nI am 30F and I returned to India last year. My daughter is 6 months old and my maternity leave is about to end soon. I have decided to quit my job (tier 1, big tech, great ₹₹) to take care of my baby. Plan is to at least stay home until my daughter is 12-18 months old and also use this time to think about next professional endeavors that I can ideally pursue for life - not necessarily a 9 to 5. \n\nCouple of things that helped me decide: \n\n1) Husband and I are financially independent - I don’t *need* a job anymore. \n\n2) I feel like childcare in India is unreliable - parents will often hire day nannies who are most likely not qualified for the same. I know multiple couples who just put up with their nannies for the lack of other options. Attrition is also high - risk of children developing attachment issues. Daycare centers exist but quality is hit or miss. I wouldn’t mind sending my daughter to a vetted daycare once she is older, but six months is not the right time. \n\n3) No family in current city of residence. \n\n4) My child at six months needs me much more than I need my job. I’d rather take this break and enjoy these fleeting years with my baby. She’s growing up rapidly and I want to be there 100% for her initial years. \n\nHope something works out for you!",
