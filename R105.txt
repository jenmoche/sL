But after 12th, my family’s financial condition wasn’t great. My father couldn’t say it outright, but I understood the situation and dropped out of college myself. Since then, my career has been on a downward spiral.\n\nThe first year after dropping out, I worked in e-commerce for just ₹5K/month. Then I was jobless for a whole year. In 2024, I got into real estate sales with a ₹25K salary, but since I had no prior experience, I struggled to convert clients into cash deals, and they fired me in 7 months. Now, I’ve been jobless for 3 months since December.\n\nJob losses and career struggles happen to a lot of people, so that’s not even the biggest issue. The real problem is that I don’t have a degree or a stable job. Every time I go to a family function, relatives throw subtle jabs like salt on a wound. My father is supportive, but these people keep filling his ears with negativity. I have a deep passion for the stock market, but that isn’t working out for me right now either. My parents remind me of my failures daily. Even my friends have stopped calling. The jobs I do find either pay less than ₹10K for 10-hour shifts or just don’t work out.\n\nI feel like I’m stuck from every direction. If any of you have been in a similar situation, what would you do? I need some advice.",
