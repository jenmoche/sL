He’s the kind of guy who plays football for 4 hours a day, then goes to the gym, and afterward cycles 50 km almost daily.

He has somehow learned his way through SQL and Excel but is still finding it very hard to land even a decent internship. Now, he's telling me he’ll work in sales jobs or BPOs for low pay, which, no offense to BPO jobs, feel like dead-end positions with limited growth potential.

Ask him to look at other options please, doing mba will do no good. If he’s inclined towards accounts, ask him to look for ACCA/CPA, and start a low paying job with any global offshore audit companies. It’s easier than MBA and there is scope for people who want to grow at doing desk jobs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
