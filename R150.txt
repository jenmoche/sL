High school onwards you'll definitely need more than 8 - 10 lakhs, as there maybe private tuitions and then coaching and preparatory in secondary school and senior secondary... for your kid, maybe if there's some surplus left with you at the end, put into a long term maturity scheme, for 12 - 15 yrs tenure, estimatedly, until your kid turns 18 so that they have the freedom to choose whatever course/career including but not limiting to medicine, flying, engineering or maybe some international stuff.\n\nIf you're targetting a one-timer, then you're looking at 2.23 - 2.27 Cr, minimum! I'd say you shoot for 2.75 or 2.5 and then during negotiations settle for 2.35. This maths is based on avged out increase in prices by 7 - 8 % owing to inflation, currency depreciation etc etc factors and considering that before univ/college the kid and you stay with your folks in a tier 2 city....\n\nSchool fees today are near about what engineering used to cost a decade back! I've lived and worked in 12+ cities across India, I've seen all the 5 zones of the country and this is based on my own observation!\n\nSuper important to make investments and get good solid mediclaim insurance, health insurance and term insurance with a very good coverage for both fo you, they are three different things and I urge you to focus on them!\n\nIf at all there's room, I'd urge you to also focus on re-education, re-skilling and re-training yourself so that you're prepared for the worst case scenario. Plus being job ready gets you closer to mental independence, having your own job even if that pays 10K is a much better sense of mental liberation! All the best!",
