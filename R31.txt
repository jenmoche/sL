Here’s my background:\n\n# Current Profile:\n\n* **Education:** MSc in Management from UCD Ireland (2022 grad).\n* **Experience:**\n   * 1 year as a Research Assistant (GTM, market analysis) at an EU university.\n   * 7 months as a Product Analyst at a financial services firm.\n   * **Current role (since July 2023):** PM/PO at an early-stage RegTech SaaS startup (€3M funding, team of 20).\n      * Led integrations in UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden.\n      * 60% core PO, 40% core PM - Also Managing partnerships with e-commerce startups\n      * Skills: APIs, product analytics, UX, Python basics (Pandas, NumPy), Git, building small AI agents (side projects), learning DevOps.\n* **Certifications:** CSPO.\n\n# Why Move?\n\n* **Personal:** Need to support my parents in India.\n* **Professional:** Startup is open to me working remotely as a contractor (annual contract). Alternatively, I could negotiate a 0.5% equity stake + slight raise to stay in Dublin, but I’m unsure about long-term growth here.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. **Contractor Stigma:** If I work remotely from India as a contractor for a year, will this hurt my chances of landing a full-time role in India later?\n2. **Salary Expectations:** With 4 years of total experience (incl. research), what salary range should I target for PM/PO roles in India? \n3. **Skill Gaps:** What skills or domain expertise am I missing to be competitive in India’s PM market?\n4. **General Advice:** Any red flags in my plan? Should I push for equity/stay longer in Ireland?\n\nI’ve tried reaching out on LinkedIn but got ghosted, would really help if you can give me your honest takes. Thanks in advance!",

Thanks a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even on the Contract Role, I would still remain the PM, not a consultant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any unrealistic salary expectations. I am well aware that Big Tech PM roles in INdia go to IIMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will aim to atleast have two offers as you said, before I make the move as you advised. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for your advise, mate 🙏🏼&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Attend interviews and inform the company about your plans and why you are planning to come to India. Also, check on the salary before committing anything. Once Everything is finalised you can then put down your papers in current Org and move back to India.   \n  \nOne person I had interviewed last year was doing the same thing, she was into Ai/ML, she scouted for jobs and was very aware of the salary she would get in India. \n\n1. **Contractor Stigma**: Is it like consultant role or would be like contract employee? Either way, if you are skilled enough, there won't be any problem. Companies hire on what value you can bring. Specially the startups  \n2. **Salary Expectations:** It mostly depends on the role (Eg: Seniority, complexity of the role). Don't expect 100K$ / year in India. Checkout jobs on Linkedin, look for mostly funded startups if you want a meaty package.   \n3. **Skill Gaps:** Not a product manager, so I wouldn't be able to answer that. But if you skilled in your work, and you match the requirements the companies have then it shouldn't be a concern. (Sometimes companies tend to extend work hours and also ask to take care of other tasks that might be irrelevant to your profile, be prepared for that)  \n4. **General Advice:** Try the first applying in India, see how it goes. Then decide about it. Once the decision is made don't think about it too much or crib about it later when things are not working out (If you decided to stay in Ireland or move back to India). At the end it will be your decision and you chose it to be that way. \n\nAlso, have atleast 2 offers (bare minimum) in hand before you make a move out of Ireland. Make sure to choose the best one, and inform the other one in Prior (atleast 10-15 days) that you won't be joining the team. So that they are not ghosted and they can look out for another person for the same role.",
