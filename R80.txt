Long post alert but I could really use some advice.\nI did my masters in pharmacy from a reputed Indian institution and worked in healthcare consulting for about 3 years. Moved to Australia and worked in an Australian university as a market analyst (market intelligence work in education sector) again for 3 years. Then worked for a major pharmaceutical company for around an year and then shifted back to education sector.\nWe will be moving back to India in around 2 years and now my skills set are in project management, data and market analysis and stakeholder management. I am afraid that despite my strong skills set and experience, I will be unemployable in the Indian market because Indian companies need experience in the same sector they are operating in, my experience in education sector will not be valuable in India, and I have heard that Indian companies disregard international experience.\nWhat do you all think about this? How should I approach Indian recruiters and which industries? Should I study some higher degree here? Will that add some value or should I upskill from an Indian institution such as IIM? I could really use some insight please. Thank you üôèüèº",
