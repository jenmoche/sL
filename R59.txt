            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m moving back to **Bangalore** next week after spending the last **4 years in Canada** (2 years studying, 1 year job searching, and 1 year working), and I’m hoping to get some advice and perspective from those who’ve gone through a similar transition.\n\nI moved to Canada right after my **bachelor’s in India** to pursue a **Master’s in Computer Science**, and after graduating, I worked for about a year in a **Java, Spring Boot, and Node.js** role. Unfortunately, I was **laid off in December 2024**, and my **work permit expires early next year**. Even if I do manage to land another job, it won’t be enough to secure PR, so I’ve decided to return to India now for long-term stability.\n\nEmotionally, I’m feeling okay about the move — I **won’t miss Canada too much**, apart from the **comfort and lifestyle**. There was never any pressure from my family to settle abroad, and in fact, my **parents are happy** that I’m coming back. I’m also a **single child**, so they’re especially glad to have me closer. There’s no regret about relocating, but I am still processing the **uncertainty of restarting life and work** in India.\n\nSince I **don’t have any prior work experience in India**, I’m aware I’ll likely need to approach the job market almost like a **fresher**, despite my international Master’s and one year of experience.\n\nAt the same time, my **parents have started bringing up matrimonial discussions**. They’d like to begin looking **around 6 months after I get a job** (I’m **27M**), with the hope of marriage before I turn 30 — possibly around 28. I understand where they’re coming from and they’ve been quite reasonable — they’re not expecting anything extravagant and are fine if I start around **6 LPA** and grow gradually. Still, these added expectations during a **career reset** can be mentally overwhelming at times. I do worry about being perceived as “unstable” by prospective matches or their families due to the recent transition and modest starting salary.\n\nThankfully, my family is **financially stable** and we have **no loans or urgent pressures**. I’m trying to stay grounded and focused, but I’m still figuring out how to best **position myself in the Indian job market** and rebuild from here.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from others who’ve been through something similar. Specifically:\n\n* How did you approach **restarting your career**, especially without prior Indian work experience?\n* What helped you stay **motivated and focused** during this transition period?\n* How did you **balance family and marriage expectations** while still figuring out your own career path?\n\nIt feels like I’m **closing one chapter and starting another**, and I’d like to do it in a grounded, thoughtful way. I want to make the most of this next phase. I know things won’t fall into place overnight, but I’d really love to hear how others navigated this stage and any lessons you’d be willing to share.\n\nThanks for reading, and wishing the best to others who are on a similar journey. Feel free to connect personally if you’re also about to start your IT job search in Bangalore or Hyderabad.",

When I moved to Canada almost everyone told me “you don’t have Canadian experience so you have to start at entry level”. I’m glad I didn’t fall for that. Same thing will be true in India too. If you think it’s a reset and you have to start as a fresher then you’ll get lowballed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Family expectations:\nOne thing that’s not apparent early on while working in US/Canada is how parent’s health catches up on them and at that time your roots are stronger in America, and the time difference will add more pressure to it. It’s not just your parents being glad, 15-20 years from now you may also be glad to be close to your parents when they need you. \nAs for matrimony: it’s up to you to figure out what you want. It’s exactly like a job market. You interview with a lot of prospects and finalize. It’s a lot easier to command flexibility (in timeline) if your professional profile is strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So here is the AI summary of the article so you don't have to share your info.\n\nThe article \"Thinking of Moving Back to India?\" from The Weekly Chai explores the considerations and steps for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) contemplating a return to India.\n\nKey reasons for this trend include escalating living costs in foreign countries, the desire to be closer to aging parents, the pursuit of a better work-life balance, and the appeal of India's expanding economy.\n\nThe piece stresses the significance of understanding Indian tax residency, particularly the distinctions between Resident and Ordinarily Resident (ROR) and Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR) statuses, and their implications for tax liabilities. It also guides readers through financial adjustments such as converting NRI bank accounts, handling U.S. credit cards, and building credit in India.\n\nPractical aspects like finding housing, securing school admissions for children, obtaining health insurance, and arranging essential services like phone and internet are covered. The article also acknowledges potential hurdles such as cultural readjustment, dealing with bureaucracy, and feelings of isolation.
