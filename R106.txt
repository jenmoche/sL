I went there right after my bachelor’s in India to pursue a **Master’s in Computer Science**, and after graduating, I worked for about a year in a **Java, Spring Boot, and Node.js** role.\n\nI was laid off in **December 2024**, and with my work permit expiring early next year — and no realistic path to PR at this stage — I’ve decided to return to India for **long-term stability** and to focus on rebuilding my career here.\n\nI don’t feel any resentment about moving back, and I won’t miss Canada too much — aside from the comfort and convenience. I will be closer to parents. My focus is now on moving forward with clarity and purpose. Thankfully, I’m not under financial pressure and have a solid support system at home, so my current focus is on **learning, growth, and building a stable career**, rather than chasing the highest-paying job right away.\n\nSince I don’t have prior work experience in India, I’m realistic that I may be seen as an **entry-level or junior developer** — and I’m okay with that. I’m looking to start somewhere reasonable (around **6–8 LPA**) and grow from there with consistent effort.\n\nI’d really appreciate insight from folks who’ve made similar transitions or are familiar with the Indian tech hiring landscape. Specifically:\n\n* What’s the best way to **prepare for tech interviews** here? (DSA, system design, project-based prep, etc.)\n* Are there any platforms beyond **LinkedIn and Naukri** that are worth exploring for Bangalore/Hyderabad tech jobs?\n* Are there any **courses, certifications, or skill gaps** I should work on to boost my profile? I’m comfortable with **Java and Spring Boot basics**.\n* What are **realistic salary and role expectations** for someone with a Master’s from abroad and 1 year of experience?\n* What types of **companies or roles** should I aim for to get back into the industry quickly without stalling long-term growth?\n* How do you structure your **daily job search**, and stay consistent with upskilling without burning out?\n* And on a personal note — how do you manage **self-doubt or imposter syndrome** during uncertain job phases like this?\n\nWhile I’m grateful for the support I have, it hasn’t been emotionally easy. Some days bring doubts about where things are headed. But I want to treat this not as a setback, but as a **chance to reset, re-align, and build something sustainable**.\n\nI’m committed to putting in the work — I just want to be smart about where I focus and how I grow from here. If you’ve gone through something similar, or have advice for someone in this spot, I’d be grateful to hear it.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and insights!",
