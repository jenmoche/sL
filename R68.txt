What i wanted to make you understand is that the years you have spent till 12th as a commerce student and will do further for 3 more years will be your fundamentals for life long. Opting commerce means a bad choice is a just a stigma.\nYou pick up any job role that requires a commerce guy , your fundamentals will be the most essential. \n\n2.  Like for example : Big International Investment companies hire for a particular job position called : Quant Analyst/Financial Analyst \nnot a lot of people know what they do, how they do, you wont find youtube tutorials either , because these are niche jobs and extremely competitive as well. If you search up for this , you would find subjects like stoichiometric economics , statistics , advanced mathematics , python , sql as their job requirements.\nThis role is mostly for those who either have a phd in maths or stats or economics or mtech in CS/ece  ( because they have few of the basics of those subjects in their curriculum), Notice the flexibility. Though an Engg is eligible  for this position but someone with maths/stats/economics phd will be preferred. People who take these are not extremely proficient in programming but need to learn it anyway because that's how much competitive it has become. That's why it is just a tool.\n\nSo pick up the niche job positions , ask better qualified people like someone who is a CA or a CFA of some big companies if you could get in touch with, try career counseling to set you up some meeting with VIPs to whom you could ask the right questions( Do your homework and ask valuable questions to avoid the general answers ). They have better understandings of their market, and they could help you to see better job roles than just BA/DA. \nBasically, explore what a commerce can become specially in the niche jobs.\n\nI mean BA/DA is fine but it is an ambiguous title or field , if you say that to someone , that person will be confused about what you actually do. For example You never get confused when someone says CA, do you? Because its niche. And has become obvious as well  about how competitive it is. Infact in IT sector that term is  mostly generalised with someone who sorts, clean , and updates data not more than that and yes few presentations as well but thats not valued much in here but the BA/DA in investment companies mean someone who does the data analysis just as above  but more than that, liek financial modelling, risk assessment, project management etc in-short upcoming data scientists, report generation ( not ppt presentation  but actually decision making worth market insights, companies loose or gain by this). \n\n\n3. Your question about foreign opportunities was a valuable question. Companies abroad have different ethics and professionalism than India , so you definitely have better chances their if your curriculum includes B.com with BA/DA. Why? Companies there are transparent about what they actually want from their candidates and what work they will be doing, so even little experience can make you stand out. But ofc beware of the universities that take in foreign students in mass like it used to be canada. Thise curriculums had no fruit to offer. And we are looking the consequences those students who migrated from india now. \nLook for in the UK, Sweden , Germany, Australia, France etc also if you can then try making it into premium ones be it merit or scholarship or money , whatever but guarantee your return of investment. \nBut it would be better for you to get into premium inst.s in india for Bcom and then for Masters there, you would have broader understanding of your line of work. \n\nThis point becomes valuable because for the specific job role you aspire , India does not have much of a good definition, and whatever there is it is because of those very  foreign companies that have investments here. Finding niche jobs and cutting the competition is more possible there than here , imo.\n\n\nDon't stress on this much right now. Just try to get in those good colleges for a bcom, use that time to meet people who have seen better future , then make a call. You are still very young to decide what you would actually to do the rest of your life.",

Why?\nPeople who go into Tech companies as a BA/DA are those with Engg. Degrees , and with more y.o.e  they become suitable to become Data Engineer/Data Scientist etc which would be hard for you with a B.Com as you would lack the fundamentals.\n\nSo, instead you should look into Finance Companies like JPMC, morgan stanley, goldman sachs, citigroup, wells fargo, hsbc etc which are top international companies in banking /investment/financial solutions sector which is where your B.Com fundamentals as well as 12th commerce would come into application. \nThough these companies have diversified their operations so they also hire techie Btech Ba /Da guy but they ask for CFA/PGDBF/MBA/CMA/FRM/CA/CFP/CIIA/ICMAI/Masters in economics etc qualified candidates specifically which is what someone pursues after B.Com. \n\nThing is, after BCom the scenario at present in India is not like Btech or BE. They usually need to pursue master's to get better job , which is low in number already ( Which is also one of the reasons Btech / BE has saturated over 2 decades because everyone wants to start working right after college and so as a result they land onto tech companies doing whatever they are given to do, whereas the roles and positions for a above mentioned qualifications after BCom are discrete) \n\nIf you are specifically looking into data analytics kind of job roles in  sectors like  Tech ,  Pharma, Ecommerce , Retail etc them BCom would not be a wise decision. \nOnly Finance is your go to but they need either masters /CA with toppings of SQL,Python, Excel as secondary skills.\n\nBut if you chose data analytics just because it seemed to promise better career then you should look more into opportunities for  bcom grad rather than in data analytics. \n\nJust to give few hints as you are so young, \n1. Once your Bcom is completed ( taking BA/DA speciality while pursuing is no harm , it only makes your resume worth looking at so if you can get it better ) you can try to get PGDBF from institutes like ISI kolkata etc , that program is specifically for data analytics field irrespective of grad degree and helps you land into big companies as DA where working for 4 - 5 years will help you get Data scientist or Quant Analyst roles which are very distant job roles to each other but people choose according to their preferences. \n2. Other options are going for Master's in Economics/CA/CMA/ICAI/FRM etc to be apt for better pay and work but it takes a lot of hard work and years to crack those exams.\n3. Then comes options like MBA ( from where i leave that upto you) that can fetch you jobs at Public Sector Undertaking Banks like SBI, CBI, UBI etc all the nationalised banks also at Private banks  like in Axis HDFC,ICICI ,Kotak, insurance companies etc in Marketing , Sales, credit / risk management profiles which is the only go to for any BCom grad to start working after studies if he /she is not that brilliant to land into IIMs for an MBA or is tired of pursuing CA. \nAll of these pay handsome.",
