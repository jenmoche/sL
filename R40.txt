Here’s my background:\n\n# Current Profile:\n\n* **Education:** MSc in Management from UCD Ireland (2022 grad).\n* **Experience:**\n   * 1 year as a Research Assistant (GTM, market analysis) at an EU university.\n   * 7 months as a Product Analyst at a financial services firm.\n   * **Current role (since July 2023):** PM/PO at an early-stage RegTech SaaS startup (€3M funding, team of 20).\n      * Led integrations in UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden.\n      * 60% core PO, 40% core PM - Also Managing partnerships with e-commerce startups\n      * Skills: APIs, product analytics, UX, Python basics (Pandas, NumPy), Git, building small AI agents (side projects), learning DevOps.\n* **Certifications:** CSPO.\n\n# Why Move?\n\n* **Personal:** Need to support my parents in India.\n* **Professional:** Startup is open to me working remotely as a contractor (annual contract). Alternatively, I could negotiate a 0.5% equity stake + slight raise to stay in Dublin, but I’m unsure about long-term growth here.\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. **Contractor Stigma:** If I work remotely from India as a contractor for a year, will this hurt my chances of landing a full-time role in India later?\n2. **Salary Expectations:** With 4 years of total experience (incl. research), what salary range should I target for PM/PO roles in India? \n3. **Skill Gaps:** What skills or domain expertise am I missing to be competitive in India’s PM market?\n4. **General Advice:** Any red flags in my plan? Should I push for equity/stay longer in Ireland?\n\nI’ve tried reaching out on LinkedIn but got ghosted, would really help if you can give me your honest takes. Thanks in advance!",
