Iâ€™ve always been career-driven, and stepping away from my financial independence is a bit daunting\n\nIf youâ€™ve been through something similar, Iâ€™d love to hear your experiences:\n\n1. How did you manage the emotional and mental shift from being financially independent and having a high-paying career to adjusting to a new environment?\n2.Did you find it easy or difficult to get back into a high-paying role once you settled in?\n3.How did you stay productive or keep yourself motivated during the transition?\n\nIâ€™d really appreciate any tips, or stories you might have. \n\nThanks in advance ðŸŒ»",
