So down to earth can't express it in words. I started feeling that I can't compare myself to him. Though he was very excited about our compatibility I still assured him to take his dating time ~6mons atleast. \n\nFast forward, we met after 2weeks of chats+VCs and he shared his personal life very honestly to the extent perhaps I can't do. When he came to India, I was head over heels for him.. he was far better looking, veryy cute from pics (non-gymming physique) don't know how but clicked my first relationship (may be I got emotionally attached by then) with the type of genuine gentleman I always wanted. Love seemed real that too in AM!\n\n\nThough I was mentally prepared for his rejection as we both hail from the same ethnicity where casteism is pretty dominant. But he was very excited about our compatibility. We are poles apart as have very different music taste etc. but IMO complimentary too. As I have always been in culturally diverse background.\n\nWe had a few disagreemental short fights too. In Jan, I had my end sems, UGC NET and am living with my family so, can't VC/talk openly. They were aware about him. And Ind-US LDR it's tough but yeah it was going fine as I never felt any ignorance or less efforts from his side. But yeah 2weeks back exams khatm huye, baatchit khatm hui aur ham bhi khatm ho gaye!\n\n\nHe said good bye citing he earlier had feelings for me but now he DON'T feel for me as I am 'the one' for him and we would have disagreements based on our diverse interests which tbh I haven't talked openly yet. \n\nHave no hard feelings for him. Talked to him after his goodbye, got no red flags or shortcomings in me. \n\nUsually many guys reject as they don't want more intelligent/ambitious wife as my career can excel well in future but I know where's he is coming from. I lack that attractiveness that a man is attracted to. I don't live the way a girl should be!\n\nI don't live like a well maintained girl, have tomboy dressing sense, don't carry handbags (instead carry backpack), have good length hairs now, means no adaa, no bhav-nakhde, very straightforward..doing everything on my own as a independent person should do.

            "body": "&gt; In Jan, I had my end sems, UGC NET and am living with my family so, can't VC/talk openly. They were aware about him. And Ind-US LDR it's tough but yeah it was going fine as I never felt any ignorance or less efforts from his side. But yeah 2weeks back exams khatm huye, baatchit khatm hui aur ham bhi khatm ho gaye!\n\nI was once in a situation where I was talking to a girl, who used to call me almost daily and talk in a heartfelt manner. A while later, she stopped calling me and wouldn’t respond to my messages. I was hurt that she ghosted me and didn’t even inform why or what went wrong. Then a few days later, she called and informed that she couldn’t talk because her family was visiting her. But that point of time was too late for me and because I was hurt, I fought with her and ended things.\n\n\nOf your entire post, the quoted part kept me wondering, was there a pause in your communication that made him fight and break up with you?\n\nIgnore the people who say he ended things because you are out of his league. He was aware of your background and had seen you in-person, yet he developed feelings after that. He definitely would have pursued you if you were how you were before Jan. \n\nIt is possible he ended things because he didn’t see you being open with him in those end-sem days? Have things ended in a way that prevents you from getting clarity?\n\nYou should not change yourself to be a different person that you know you aren’t and you’ll still find someone who likes you for who you are. If I were him, I would have pursued you regardless of tomboyish style. I appreciate being straightforward and direct instead of bhav-nakhras. I prefer low-maintainance girls. In fact, my wife is very similar to how you have described yourself to be. My wife found someone who liked her for who she was. You’ll too.",

They were aware about him. And Ind-US LDR it&amp;#39;s tough but yeah it was going fine as I never felt any ignorance or less efforts from his side. But yeah 2weeks back exams khatm huye, baatchit khatm hui aur ham bhi khatm ho gaye!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was once in a situation where I was talking to a girl, who used to call me almost daily and talk in a heartfelt manner. A while later, she stopped calling me and wouldn’t respond to my messages. I was hurt that she ghosted me and didn’t even inform why or what went wrong. Then a few days later, she called and informed that she couldn’t talk because her family was visiting her. But that point of time was too late for me and because I was hurt, I fought with her and ended things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of your entire post, the quoted part kept me wondering, was there a pause in your communication that made him fight and break up with you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignore the people who say he ended things because you are out of his league. He was aware of your background and had seen you in-person, yet he developed feelings after that. He definitely would have pursued you if you were how you were before Jan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is possible he ended things because he didn’t see you being open with him in those end-sem days? Have things ended in a way that prevents you from getting clarity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should not change yourself to be a different person that you know you aren’t and you’ll still find someone who likes you for who you are. If I were him, I would have pursued you regardless of tomboyish style. I appreciate being straightforward and direct instead of bhav-nakhras. I prefer low-maintainance girls. In fact, my wife is very similar to how you have described yourself to be. My wife found someone who liked her for who she was. You’ll too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
