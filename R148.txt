Currently, I have a decent-paying job, and things on the surface seem fine, but I’m feeling a bit lost and unsure if this is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to explore my future options before I commit long-term.\n\nHere are the options I’m considering, and I’d love to hear your experiences, thoughts, or advice:\n\n1. Staying in Corporate India (Software Engineering)\nI could continue in the corporate world here, work my way up, and hopefully see good salary hikes over the years.\nWhat are the pros and cons of this path in the long run? Is the growth worth it in India? How sustainable is it in terms of work-life balance and financial growth?\n\n2. Moving Abroad (Same Career Track)\nI’ve been thinking about moving abroad for work, still as a software engineer.\nIs this a feasible option? What countries are realistic to target as an Indian fresher or with a few years of experience? Is the move worth the hassle in terms of quality of life and financial growth?\n\n3. Doing an MBA\nI hear this option thrown around a lot, especially after 2-3 years in the tech industry. But honestly, I’m not very inclined toward it emotionally.\nCan someone explain the real pros and cons of doing an MBA in India or abroad? Would it significantly shift my career or earnings in a way that makes it worth it, especially if I’m not passionate about business roles?\n\n4. Working for Central Ministries (Govt / Public Sector)\nI have a strong interest in India’s political and policy landscape and sometimes feel the urge to do something meaningful for the country.\nWhat does a future in working with central ministries or government advisory roles look like for someone with a tech background? Is it financially sustainable? How do people enter such roles (UPSC, lateral entries, fellowships)?\n\nMy Priorities:\nWhile I do want to make an impact, financial security and long-term wealth are very important to me. So whatever I choose, I want to make sure it doesn't put me at serious financial disadvantage down the line.\n\nI know this is a mixed bag, but I genuinely need some guidance to help make a smart and fulfilling move for my future. If you've been through any of these paths or have advice, I’d really appreciate your inputs.\n\n\nTLDR:\nFresher software engineer in India feeling lost. Considering 4 options — stay in Indian corporate, move abroad, do an MBA, or work for the government. Money matters. Need advice on what path makes sense.\n\n",
