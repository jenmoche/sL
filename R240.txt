We initially agreed that we’ll stay in Germany for around 2 years and then move back to India — mostly because she prefers returning long-term.\n\nHowever, I feel that once she gets here and experiences life here (quality of life, work-life balance, opportunities), she *might* change her mind — or at least consider building a future here. I don’t want to push anything on her, but I also want to keep options open for both our careers.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. **Are there good job opportunities in Germany for Indian CAs (with Big4/Wipro experience)?** Especially if she learn German by that time?\n2. **For someone like me with 3–4 years of IT experience**, is it a good idea to move back to India after 2 years abroad, or will that hurt my career?\n3. **How do we make a decision where neither of us has to sacrifice our career goals?**\n\nI know there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations — mixed career goals, international relocation, long-distance relationships, balancing personal and professional life.\n\nAny advice, stories, or insights would mean a lot!",
