            "body": "Sorry if this reply is all over the place but I tried to be as thorough as possible. Please take all of this advice with a huge grain of salt. My credentials: I've worked as a storyboard artist for over a decade at studios like Disney Animation, Dreamworks Animation, and Marvel Animation, etc. I primarily specialize in action storyboards for 3D shows. A lot of what I have to say is likely debatable and is based only on my personal experiences. I cannot speak for everyone or the animation industry as a whole.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nAsk yourself - What is the #1 thing you want to do - Tell your own stories? Or have fun animating OTHER people's stories?\n\nBeing an animator means you'll spend 99% of your life making other people's stories come to life and there's almost no path from being an animator to running your own show. Animators becoming show runners just by animating is basically the same as trying to win the lottery several times in a row.\n\nIf you want to make a show and tell your own stories, you need to learn how to be a creative producer - even if that means producing a small web series or a single short-film where you raise money and hire writers/artists and lead them on a production.\n\n**IF YOU JUST WANT TO TELL STORIES**\n\nLearn to write. Write short stories. Write scripts. Write simple gags. Keep doing it. Make drawings or simple loop animations to go along with them. Sometimes people get into animation because they really want to be writers, then they find out they don't love drawing for other people and don't realize it until it's WAY too late and become miserable and burn out. It happens a LOT.\n\n**IF YOU JUST WANT TO ANIMATE:**\n\nMake it your side hobby and share your work as much as possible online. In the meantime, work a regular job and save as much money as possible.\n\nGet really good at saving money. You will need money for software/equipment/unemployment.\n\nNiche down and specialize: Get really good at animating a specific kind of animation (action, emotion, comedy, etc). If you're too generalized it becomes much harder to stand out and get people's attention.\n\nDo fan animations: People will pay more attention to existing characters that they love.\n\nChoose characters that are similar to what you personally want to do. For example: I used to do a bunch of ninja, action animations with lots of acrobatics, and it got me a job working on a spiderman show.\n\nMake lots of animation friends. Help them with their projects and they may help you with yours.\n\nYour friends are how you will find jobs. I've never gotten a job by testing or submitting a portfolio. It's always been a personal project I put online or a friend's recommendation who has gotten me work.\n\nFreelance means you are on a contract for a specific project. When that project is over, you are unemployed again. There are very few places that offer full-time employment. The hours and expectations for both are the same. The one advantage that freelancers have is they can work on multiple jobs at the same time without getting in trouble.\n\nIn the US and Canada we have an animation Guild. They guarantee us decent wages and good hours. Almost nowhere else in the world has that for animators. You may want to try to target North American studios for work.\n\nGET A DEGREE for something practical like Business, finance, or Engineering (in case you need a fallback).\n\nDO NOT GET AN ANIMATION DEGREE. No one will ever look at your resume for a degree in animation. No one will ever respect an animation degree. Just be really good, very organized, and very professional at what you do. Most well-regarded and successful animators I know used to be accountants, architects, biology majors, etc. Everyone I went to animation school with and got art degrees washed out of the industry completely. I happened to be lucky.\n\nMost \"animators\" in North America are actually storyboard artists. 2d and 3d storyboards are mostly the same skillset. Actual animation is pretty much always outsourced to international studios. Since you said you want to write stories, doing storyboards might be more appropriate for you. Dedicated animators do not get to make changes or storytelling decisions as much as storyboard artists.\n\nPlan on working your body until it gets injured. Have a backup plan for when (not IF) this happens. Animation, even on computers, is physically demanding, and you can't do it forever. Have a plan for when you can no longer do the job.\n\n**IF YOU WANT YOUR OWN SHOW:**\n\nMaking your own show requires a completely different skillset: You basically need to understand business and how to raise money and understand how to run a production / hire people / make contracts, etc. It's possible, but it means you're not trying to be the ARTIST, you're trying to be the BUSINESS PERSON / CREATIVE LEAD who HIRES the artists (or at the very least raises money so you can be your own artist).\n\nIf your long-term goal is to create a show, then focus on learning how to pitch to studios, how the business operates, making connections with not just artists but also producers and investors, how to raise money, and creating a strategy for how your productions will make a profit. People who produce short films make their money by entering in film festivals and earning prize money or by partnering with a business who can use your animations as part of their marketing strategy. Becoming a creative producer is a completely different world from being an animator.",

                                "body": "\\- I'm from LA so I basically grew up on Hollywood's doorstep.\n\n\\- You can learn a lot about production by creating a youtube channel. It's basically the same as having your own show and there's TONS of tutorials on youtube production. But you want to focus on scheduling, networking with other creatives, and ways to raise money (like crowdfunding). There are also plenty of resources on how to pitch ideas and you can google pitch bibles (for example - this is the Stranger Things pitch bible: [https://screencraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/StrangerThings\\_Bible.pdf](https://screencraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/StrangerThings_Bible.pdf) ) It's a whole different world from just being an animator.\n\n\\- To become a storyboard artist you can follow the \"animator\" path I detailed above. But, instead of doing full animation, you just need to make animatics which are rough drafts created before the animation.\n\n\\- I can only speak on NA market, but if you're not in the guild and are just starting out, you have to negotiate your own rate. Go on hiring sites like Fiverr to compare the amounts other animators in your country are charging and see if that will be enough to sustain you. It's really important not to undersell yourself (even if you're desperate). Always ask for a living wage. Don't rely on animation to make a living until you're good enough for someone to WANT to pay you a decent wage for it. As an artist you have to learn to treat yourself as if you're a small business owner. Doing fan animations online and having a patreon is often a good way to go just to have some money coming in regularly. Build up an audience and have people commission you and set your pricing appropriately.\n\n\\- The Guild in North America starts wages out at around the 70-80k range and goes up as you gain seniority to about the 120k+ range. The Guild only sets the minimum amount you can get paid, so if you're very popular and in demand, you can negotiate for higher. You only join the guild if you can get hired at a studio that has a contract with the Guild (which requires moving to the US - but the cost of living is also much higher here).

It&amp;#39;s basically the same as having your own show and there&amp;#39;s TONS of tutorials on youtube production. But you want to focus on scheduling, networking with other creatives, and ways to raise money (like crowdfunding). There are also plenty of resources on how to pitch ideas and you can google pitch bibles (for example - this is the Stranger Things pitch bible: &lt;a href=\"https://screencraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/StrangerThings_Bible.pdf\"&gt;https://screencraft.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/StrangerThings_Bible.pdf&lt;/a&gt; ) It&amp;#39;s a whole different world from just being an animator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- To become a storyboard artist you can follow the &amp;quot;animator&amp;quot; path I detailed above. But, instead of doing full animation, you just need to make animatics which are rough drafts created before the animation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I can only speak on NA market, but if you&amp;#39;re not in the guild and are just starting out, you have to negotiate your own rate. Go on hiring sites like Fiverr to compare the amounts other animators in your country are charging and see if that will be enough to sustain you. It&amp;#39;s really important not to undersell yourself (even if you&amp;#39;re desperate). Always ask for a living wage. Don&amp;#39;t rely on animation to make a living until you&amp;#39;re good enough for someone to WANT to pay you a decent wage for it. As an artist you have to learn to treat yourself as if you&amp;#39;re a small business owner. Doing fan animations online and having a patreon is often a good way to go just to have some money coming in regularly. Build up an audience and have people commission you and set your pricing appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The Guild in North America starts wages out at around the 70-80k range and goes up as you gain seniority to about the 120k+ range. The Guild only sets the minimum amount you can get paid, so if you&amp;#39;re very popular and in demand, you can negotiate for higher. You only join the guild if you can get hired at a studio that has a contract with the Guild (which requires moving to the US - but the cost of living is also much higher here). Think strategically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this reply is all over the place but I tried to be as thorough as possible. Please take all of this advice with a huge grain of salt. My credentials: I&amp;#39;ve worked as a storyboard artist for over a decade at studios like Disney Animation, Dreamworks Animation, and Marvel Animation, etc. I primarily specialize in action storyboards for 3D shows. A lot of what I have to say is likely debatable and is based only on my personal experiences. I cannot speak for everyone or the animation industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself - What is the #1 thing you want to do - Tell your own stories? Or have fun animating OTHER people&amp;#39;s stories?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being an animator means you&amp;#39;ll spend 99% of your life making other people&amp;#39;s stories come to life and there&amp;#39;s almost no path from being an animator to running your own show. Animators becoming show runners just by animating is basically the same as trying to win the lottery several times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a show and tell your own stories, you need to learn how to be a creative producer - even if that means producing a small web series or a single short-film where you raise money and hire writers/artists and lead them on a production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU JUST WANT TO TELL STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn to write. Write short stories. Write scripts. Write simple gags. Keep doing it. Make drawings or simple loop animations to go along with them. Sometimes people get into animation because they really want to be writers, then they find out they don&amp;#39;t love drawing for other people and don&amp;#39;t realize it until it&amp;#39;s WAY too late and become miserable and burn out. It happens a LOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU JUST WANT TO ANIMATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make it your side hobby and share your work as much as possible online. In the meantime, work a regular job and save as much money as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get really good at saving money. You will need money for software/equipment/unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niche down and specialize: Get really good at animating a specific kind of animation (action, emotion, comedy, etc). If you&amp;#39;re too generalized it becomes much harder to stand out and get people&amp;#39;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do fan animations: People will pay more attention to existing characters that they love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choose characters that are similar to what you personally want to do. For example: I used to do a bunch of ninja, action animations with lots of acrobatics, and it got me a job working on a spiderman show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make lots of animation friends. Help them with their projects and they may help you with yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your friends are how you will find jobs. I&amp;#39;ve never gotten a job by testing or submitting a portfolio. It&amp;#39;s always been a personal project I put online or a friend&amp;#39;s recommendation who has gotten me work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freelance means you are on a contract for a specific project. When that project is over, you are unemployed again. There are very few places that offer full-time employment. The hours and expectations for both are the same. The one advantage that freelancers have is they can work on multiple jobs at the same time without getting in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the US and Canada we have an animation Guild. They guarantee us decent wages and good hours. Almost nowhere else in the world has that for animators. You may want to try to target North American studios for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GET A DEGREE for something practical like Business, finance, or Engineering (in case you need a fallback).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DO NOT GET AN ANIMATION DEGREE. No one will ever look at your resume for a degree in animation. No one will ever respect an animation degree. Just be really good, very organized, and very professional at what you do. Most well-regarded and successful animators I know used to be accountants, architects, biology majors, etc. Everyone I went to animation school with and got art degrees washed out of the industry completely. I happened to be lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most &amp;quot;animators&amp;quot; in North America are actually storyboard artists. 2d and 3d storyboards are mostly the same skillset. Actual animation is pretty much always outsourced to international studios. Since you said you want to write stories, doing storyboards might be more appropriate for you. Dedicated animators do not get to make changes or storytelling decisions as much as storyboard artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan on working your body until it gets injured. Have a backup plan for when (not IF) this happens. Animation, even on computers, is physically demanding, and you can&amp;#39;t do it forever. Have a plan for when you can no longer do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU WANT YOUR OWN SHOW:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making your own show requires a completely different skillset: You basically need to understand business and how to raise money and understand how to run a production / hire people / make contracts, etc. It&amp;#39;s possible, but it means you&amp;#39;re not trying to be the ARTIST, you&amp;#39;re trying to be the BUSINESS PERSON / CREATIVE LEAD who HIRES the artists (or at the very least raises money so you can be your own artist).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your long-term goal is to create a show, then focus on learning how to pitch to studios, how the business operates, making connections with not just artists but also producers and investors, how to raise money, and creating a strategy for how your productions will make a profit. People who produce short films make their money by entering in film festivals and earning prize money or by partnering with a business who can use your animations as part of their marketing strategy. Becoming a creative producer is a completely different world from being an animator.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
