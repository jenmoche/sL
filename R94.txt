            "selftext": "Summary:\nI chose CA over B.Tech due to job market fears, despite my natural strengths in math and logic. I later realized CA didn’t align with who I am—I struggled with theoretical subjects, comprehension, and lacked the confidence needed. I failed CA Final multiple times, battled self-doubt, lost health and time, and regret not switching earlier. Though I’ve now found work and improved financially, the regret of indecision and lost years still haunts me. I want to rebuild my confidence and career, but fear holds me back. Has anyone faced something similar? How do you overcome career regret and self-doubt?\n\nLong story:\nThere was a time when I seriously considered quitting CA at the Inter stage and pursuing MCA instead. (B.Tech wasn’t an option anymore since I had already spent 2 years on CA along with B.Com.) Looking back, I feel that’s when I started making career choices that didn’t align with who I really am.\n\nI was a disciplined student all through school and college up to the age of 21—except for about 6 months during CA Inter. In Intermediate (12th standard), I appeared for a state-level entrance exam (similar to IIT or AIEEE) and secured a 2,000 rank out of 3.5–4 lakh students. I didn’t make it to IIT, but thanks to my intermediate teachers, I developed strong math and logic skills, and that became my strength. Earlier, I used to rote-learn everything in school, but during XII standard, I really started understanding concepts. Math became my favorite subject.\n\nWhen I had the chance, I chose CA over B.Tech because everyone around me said there were no jobs for engineering graduates at that time. With my rank, I could’ve gotten a free seat in a decent college, but I went ahead with CA. It was during CA Inter that I started feeling like I wasn’t the right fit for this course. Still, I cleared Group 1 in the first attempt, but Group 2 took me three attempts. I had serious doubts, but I didn’t have the courage to speak up to my parents or anyone else and admit that this course didn’t suit my skills.Some of my friends who used to struggle with math and physics to some extent in XII standard—subjects I excelled at have put far far less effort than me in understanding and comprehending the subjects. They have aptitude and skills for CA. I realised different people excel at different things and sometimes grass is greener on other provided we are good at other side.\n\nI never felt confident with CA subjects. I struggled with English comprehension, theoretical subjects, and remembering details to much - didn't found solution to overcome those issues yet. Though I did rote learning in school and done fairly well, but vast syllabus to remember and difficult english language made my life difficult. I realised about my weakness after 12th standard -  that I had not so good memory so used to avoid reading big articles or paragraphs, in schools or colleges we havrme the option to revise that's why I was able to overcome and also I struggle to understand things on my own but if teachers' explain it I understand quickly but any conversation even if I put focus I tend to remember only as a summary that's why most afraid for consulting roles\n\nAround that time, I had also started learning C and Java on my own and realized I was actually good at problem-solving and logical thinking. But I gave it up to focus on CA. Even back then, I had this thought: “Even if I become a CA, there will always be fierce competition. Isn’t it better to compete in a field where I’m naturally good?” That constant thought made me lose focus, and when I reached CA Final, I wasn’t in the right frame of mind. I failed, and that failure broke me.\n\nI also regret how much money I ended up wasting. I registered for coaching for 3–4 subjects at once. Classes used to run for 10–11 hours a day, and without proper revision, I couldn’t retain anything. On top of that, due to poor sleep, stress, and bad food after shifting to a new location, I lost a lot of hair in 2–3 months. I went bald suddenly, and that hit my confidence hard. I had been taking care of hair, and it all seemed to fall apart at once. I looked older than I was and it shattered me inside.\n\nAfter that, my confidence in CA went down further. I attempted the Final exam four times but couldn’t clear. Deep down, I knew I wasn't good at subjects but haven't putting the extra efforts needed. When people asked, “Will you clear it next time?”, I didn’t know what to say. How could I confidently say yes when I was never confident at them? and these exams have unpredictability and risk of failure.\n\nAt home, I was constantly questioned—“Why did you choose CA? Why did you waste money?” I admitted my mistakes, but hearing those questions every day crushed my interest and motivation. Years of stress and sleepless nights ruined my health. Then the pandemic hit, and everything worsened—more anxiety, more hopelessness, no job opportunities. I finally decided to leave CA for the sake of my mental and physical health.\n\nI started working at age 26–27 (could have been earlier if not for the pandemic), earning just ₹4,000/month. But within 2–3 years, I managed to grow that to ₹18k, ₹40k, and now ₹65k/month. Still, I often feel confused—Am I really good enough? What if I had left CA earlier? Or what if I had somehow completed it and then made a switch?\n\nBack when I was in CA Final, I used to tell people that B.Tech also offers great career options if we put in the effort, but they wouldn’t listen. Everyone just said, “Complete CA at any age , your life will be set (but not everything can be delayed)” But what about the opportunity cost?\n\nI am not comparing as I know why I am in this phase is due to my wrong choices . My friends who did B.Tech are now earning ₹30–70 LPA. Maybe the grass looks greener on the other side, but I’ve come to realize that different people have different strengths. CA requires a certain skill set, and I honestly felt I didn’t have that and that killed me inside.\n\nNow, I’m scared. I don’t know if I can handle consulting roles or jobs that require reading a lot and advising clients. I don’t know if I’ve missed the boat for btech technical roles. I don’t even know if I belong in this cutthroat competitive world. I might get married soon, and I don’t want to carry this regret-filled mindset into my next phase of life. I want to work hard, get my health back, rebuild my confidence and career, but I feel lost—and fear is holding me back.\n\nI used to be a person who doesn't like to waste a minute when it comes to studies but somehow wasted years no taking any decision and that time lost is the biggest regret , I may not have felt that bad even if I failed CA but not given required effort and wasted time doing indecisively has made the regret most now.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? How do you overcome the regret of lost opportunities or wrong career paths? How do you build a new path when you feel stuck in self-doubt?\n\nAny advice would be deeply appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.\n\n(Used Chat gpt to rephrase sentences)",

CA is really uncertain and so not worth your efforts and mental trauma. This course is shit and will never be something WORTH IT because it takes your all (teenage, youth, mental and physical health and most importantly your TIME) which could never be brought back. I belong to a lower middle class family and I couldn't afford the unemployment and hence the pressure of clearing Finals ASAP. Last year I took the decision to leave CA forever due to same reasons. Rn I'm working at a school for mere 7k which wouldn't go beyond 30k-40k in next 5 years. I've decided to opt for govt exams simultaneously and if nothing works out, I'll start working 2 jobs (school + pvt coaching). I hope everything works out. Just yesterday I again felt a bit regret for leaving CA but reading your journey again made me feel like I made the right decision! Thanks for sharing the reality of this shit course. I'm miserable rn but ik I would have been way more miserable if I had continued with this course. Best luck dear. Just be happy that you opted out and are earning 65k. I'm proud of you for staying firm on your decision. Everything will be fine soon.",
