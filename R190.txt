I would prefer a rural type isolated environment like IIT KGP (ofc CSE) over city life. I would indeed get distracted by city life that i wouldn't be able to focus on college studies. \n\n&gt;KGP students have to be the most hardworking ones to firstly stand out in such a huge crowd\n\nI agree. But isn't that whats undergrads supposed to do? Work hard for a better future. Its our bad luck we have been born in such an overpopulated country and tough competition, but shouldn't we fight so that we can stand out? Ik many seniors committed su\\*c\\*des due to academic pressure. \n\nBut i am actually more interested into IIT KGP for the fact that it provides a proper space for learning &amp; working alone. If I were to get into IIT KGP I would definitely reason the following:   \n1. I don't need a gf at this point of my life, i am too young. There can definitely be better opportunities in the future.  \n2. Only pure IIT Life-&gt; so better socializing amongst batchmates and seniors  \n3. Since there's hardly any city life-&gt; So i would rather spend most of my time studying, researching, exploring various topics of my interests. \n\n4. Bengali profs-&gt; I am a bengali, and i have heard the kind of open-biasedness profs do, so why not take advantage of that? I have been suffering my whole life seeing how my classmates got so many opportunities cuz they were SC/ST/OBC/Female while i was a middle-class General male. \n\n5. Placements-&gt; As far as the situation in US is concerned rn, i would prefer a tech job in Japan over US. \n\n6. Familiarity with CS-&gt; I am not ur average \"out of school Python coder\". I won't be bragging, but honestly i actually started coding at a very early age-&gt; not stupid HTML, or python, but i was introduced to C++ back at age 12, and i already have a clear idea of CS curriculum taught at IITs. I am already way above average than ppl of my age in CS field. I am also quite familiar with DSA and i have been into Competitive Coding since age 16, so i really don't have any \"unfamiliarity\" in CS.  \n\n7. Old experienced profs-&gt; As far as i have heard, Some old Kgp profs would actually go out of their ways to motivate you-&gt; not by sweet-talking but rather by shaming, insulting, or humiliating you. Idk, u might tell me that i might have Stockholm syndrome, but to me: that isn't a bit of humiliating to me. They are government teachers, so ofc they can just keep quiet and do their jobs. So why would they go out of their way to pressurize the students? The answer is probably cuz they care about the students' future a lot.\n\n8. Despite the bad administration (as far as i have heard from many KGPians), we are here to study, not to point out the mistakes of the admin. We will be here only for 4 years and then lead our own lives. Complaining about this and that and what not. Remember ur actually lucky to get such a decent college at a place like India. Some ppl complain that certain processes take upto a week, but isn't that normal especially in a place like India?)",

                                          "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, sounds reasonable and logical. Idk man but i am different. I would prefer a rural type isolated environment like IIT KGP (ofc CSE) over city life. I would indeed get distracted by city life that i wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to focus on college studies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;KGP students have to be the most hardworking ones to firstly stand out in such a huge crowd&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree. But isn&amp;#39;t that whats undergrads supposed to do? Work hard for a better future. Its our bad luck we have been born in such an overpopulated country and tough competition, but shouldn&amp;#39;t we fight so that we can stand out? Ik many seniors committed su*c*des due to academic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i am actually more interested into IIT KGP for the fact that it provides a proper space for learning &amp;amp; working alone. If I were to get into IIT KGP I would definitely reason the following:&lt;br/&gt;\n1. I don&amp;#39;t need a gf at this point of my life, i am too young. There can definitely be better opportunities in the future.&lt;br/&gt;\n2. Only pure IIT Life-&amp;gt; so better socializing amongst batchmates and seniors&lt;br/&gt;\n3. Since there&amp;#39;s hardly any city life-&amp;gt; So i would rather spend most of my time studying, researching, exploring various topics of my interests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bengali profs-&amp;gt; I am a bengali, and i have heard the kind of open-biasedness profs do, so why not take advantage of that? I have been suffering my whole life seeing how my classmates got so many opportunities cuz they were SC/ST/OBC/Female while i was a middle-class General male. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placements-&amp;gt; As far as the situation in US is concerned rn, i would prefer a tech job in Japan over US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with CS-&amp;gt; I am not ur average &amp;quot;out of school Python coder&amp;quot;. I won&amp;#39;t be bragging, but honestly i actually started coding at a very early age-&amp;gt; not stupid HTML, or python, but i was introduced to C++ back at age 12, and i already have a clear idea of CS curriculum taught at IITs. I am already way above average than ppl of my age in CS field. I am also quite familiar with DSA and i have been into Competitive Coding since age 16, so i really don&amp;#39;t have any &amp;quot;unfamiliarity&amp;quot; in CS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old experienced profs-&amp;gt; As far as i have heard, Some old Kgp profs would actually go out of their ways to motivate you-&amp;gt; not by sweet-talking but rather by shaming, insulting, or humiliating you. Idk, u might tell me that i might have Stockholm syndrome, but to me: that isn&amp;#39;t a bit of humiliating to me. They are government teachers, so ofc they can just keep quiet and do their jobs. So why would they go out of their way to pressurize the students? The answer is probably cuz they care about the students&amp;#39; future a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad administration (as far as i have heard from many KGPians), we are here to study, not to point out the mistakes of the admin. We will be here only for 4 years and then lead our own lives. Complaining about this and that and what not. Remember ur actually lucky to get such a decent college at a place like India. Some ppl complain that certain processes take upto a week, but isn&amp;#39;t that normal especially in a place like India?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
