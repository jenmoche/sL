I moved into this space ~2.5 years ago after getting deeply interested in health, fitness, and nutrition. My role started with community building and insights, but it’s now evolved into a more business/category management-focused role.\n\nThis year, I applied to the MPH Nutrition programs at Michigan and University of Washington with a nutrition focus, but got rejected. I’m not sure if I applied too early or if my experience doesn’t align well enough.\n\nI know I want to work in the health space - maybe health education, awareness, or even working with governments/NGOs -  but I’m still figuring it out. I’m very driven to create meaningful impact in public health, but not 100% sure of the exact path yet.\n\nWould love advice on:\n- Whether my current experience is relevant for an MPH\n- What I can do this year to strengthen my profile\n- Any other routes I should consider if I want to eventually work in health policy/education/impact\n\nThanks so much in advance!",
