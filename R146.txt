I used to be active at extracurriculars in university, was into sports, debating, theater, and had leadership roles. But my academic scores are not stellar, I was suffering from mental health issues at the start of my engineering degree, because of which I wasn't able to attend classes at the onset of the degree, resulting in backlogs and my degree getting slightly extended.

I used to be really good at math and calculations in high school. That's the reason I took the engineering path.

I believe the MBA experience would help me grow as a person, I don't have strong intentions of immigrating to the country I go to permanently.
