            "selftext": "Hi everyone, this is my first post related to this community.\n\nI had been planning to post since long but I was waiting for the right moment.\n\nI have been following posts but still I couldn't find exact/proper information for me to decide.\n\nPutting some important details right below:\n\n**Personal details:**  \nI'm married and father of two baby boys.\n\n**Some brief technical details:**\n\nI have my major experience as a Java Developer and worked on Frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, Kafka, and databases like MySql, Oracle. \n\nCurrently also working on Spring Webflux.  \nAlso have used some common AWS services like EC2, RDS, Redshift.\n\n**Experience:** 7+ Years\n\n**Current salary details:**\n\n15 Lakh INR per annum (LPA)\n\n**Expected salary in UAE** (let me know if it's too high or low as per those people working over there):\n\n25000 - 30000 AED\n\nI have some key factors based on which I will decide whether it's worth moving to UAE or not?\n\nListing them below:\n\n1.**Work life Balance**\n\nHow good is the worklife there compared to Indian culture???  \nCurrently in India, I do not see worklife balance and apart from being lucky, majorly worklife balance is bad here as per my opinion. Travelling fatigue and time,  along with subpar roads and lifestyle have made me realise that it's time to move out of this country. After office hours calls and work leave me nearly no personal time to spend. \n\n2. **Salary**\n\nI am expecting at least 25000-30000 AED. Let me know if this is high. If not, then do enlighten me if sky is the limit! If I'll be switching job in India, then I'm looking at least 30 LPA and anyways higher as well depending on how well things go and the market. Comparing this to the UAE salary it is nearly half the salary but yes I know that UAE is more expensive than India. But then again it is my personal preference of upgrade of standard of living and savings are all dependent on the individual.  \n  \n**3, Technology**\n\nI have heard that still old tech is being used there in many companies.  A year ago my friend got a job and after working over there he mentioned this and said it was better in India.  \nIn my current company, I'm fed up of working on outdated tech like Play Framework and Java version 8 although I insisted on using Java 21 for the new project. I have a knack for the cutting edge tech and try to keep myself up to date as possible. I want that in my next job as well, And I just don't mean the version of tech, but I want to grow as much as I can ultimately reaching to a position like Solution Architect or Principal Software engineer. So this involves a great amount of learning.\n\n  \n**4. Job Security**\n\nI'm worried about this since my friend told me that there are not many jobs as such. And a simple search of Java Developer on naukrigulf and linkedIn shows this. Although I may be wrong here since I also heard many people got jobs through references and also by direct contact with the company hrs.   \nIs is true? Because I'm moving with wife and kids, I can't afford returning back to India due to maybe potential loss of job from unexpected reasons like cost cutting or failed startup. From next year my older son will be turning 3, so I will have to look for school admissions as well.  \nFinding a job in India is much easier and stress free.",

But most of them hire via internal references. Me myself was earning around 20 k and now when I lost my current job and looking for new ones the higher offer I am getting is like only around 12 to 15 k max.. so please make sure you have a job in hand before you move or try atleast work remotely with your current india job and switch only when you get one.. also as far as school for your kid it will be around 2 k per month per child with bus fees even in affordable schools&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You’ve gotta work your way up to get the salary you want. Most of us start low and climb high. OP, maybe stay in India for now and look for other jobs overseas that can offer permanent residency for your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be real with you. Your nationality, passport, and even your skin color can dictate your salary range. Hitting your expected salary here seems like a 50/50 chance. Hate to break it to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "body": "Check what the big companies here are working with tech wise, you might need to change your skills. Tech stacks are important to get past the first phase. I believe Revolut for example (a high paying software company) uses Java for backend so you can leverage that.\n\n\n\nSpend time on your resume to make it look good, it will matter to get that first interview. Your resume is your first impression. Make it count. And again, research the companies beforehand. If you are serious about the move, invest time into it. If the company uses python and AI (very likely these days) then study it and practice so that at least you're comfortable talking about it - no excuses with GPT/Claude nowadays.\n\n\n\nYour salary expectations for your YOE can be achieved but it's not going to be easy as you can tell by the comments. It's a competitive market, but the right opportunities are out there if you're persistent.\n\n\n\nAlso, really important, high level of English and clarity in your speech. Especially important for big software companies, which by the way are the only ones who can/will pay such salary. When interviewing, being fluent and clear on getting your point across plays a big role in getting the yes.

Your resume is your first impression. Make it count. And again, research the companies beforehand. If you are serious about the move, invest time into it. If the company uses python and AI (very likely these days) then study it and practice so that at least you&amp;#39;re comfortable talking about it - no excuses with GPT/Claude nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your salary expectations for your YOE can be achieved but it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy as you can tell by the comments. It&amp;#39;s a competitive market, but the right opportunities are out there if you&amp;#39;re persistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, really important, high level of English and clarity in your speech.
