I have not heard about those tools ever. Then he joined Oracle as Senior Member of Technical Staff. His current work is building UIs using Oracle JET Framework. I personally hate building UIs in OJET Framework even though he enjoys it. He owns the repo where I am making UI changes. But I feel building UIs using the OJET Framework is still better than using Oracle tools like Apex and all. At least you get to write Javascript.",

I have not heard about those tools ever. Then he joined Oracle as Senior Member of Technical Staff. His current work is building UIs using Oracle JET Framework. I personally hate building UIs in OJET Framework even though he enjoys it. He owns the repo where I am making UI changes. But I feel building UIs using the OJET Framework is still better than using Oracle tools like Apex and all. At least you get to write Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You don’t need to be a prodigy but still need 1-2 attempts to clear it.\n\nThen you may think of SSC-CGL type jobs. They are fine and you maybe able to get into it. However do note that they are not very different from your current job. The pay will be similar and increase gradually. The workload maybe less but the growth will be much lesser. It like trading short term work life balance with lifelong mediocrity.\n\nThen you may want to go for Govt IT jobs. This is a viable option, but IT jobs in govt come rather sparingly.
