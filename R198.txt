I’ve been working at a **Chennai-based startup** for over a year now and have poured my heart into the job—personally and professionally.\n\nIn this time, I’ve had to shoulder a lot:\n\n* I lost my father.\n* I supported my wife through **postpartum recovery** after delivering our **second daughter**.\n* I’ve undergone **surgery myself**, without any **medical insurance coverage** from the company.\n* I’m managing **school fees** for my firstborn daughter.\n* I’ve been **juggling credit cards** just to keep up with monthly expenses.\n* And now I found out that **my PF hasn’t been credited for the entire past year**—something that would have been extremely helpful during my medical emergency.\n\nDespite all of this, I never stepped away from work. I showed up, delivered on deadlines, and stayed loyal to the company and its vision.\n\nBut in return, the company has **delayed my salary for multiple months**, and every time I asked, I was promised a date—only for it to be missed again and again. The latest commitment was that **50% of my pending salary would be paid on April 25**, and now it’s April 29. Nothing has been credited, and no one is responding to me anymore.\n\nI’m at my breaking point. I didn’t go to the office today because I simply cannot balance the stress of unpaid dues with everything else. I’m seriously considering **exposing the company’s repeated lies and unethical treatment on LinkedIn**, even tagging former and current employees. But I’m afraid—will it affect my career? Will I be blacklisted?\n\nI **can’t afford legal action** right now. I’m out of resources. I just want what I earned—what I’m owed. I’ve already sacrificed so much.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, or knows what I can do—**legally, practically, or emotionally**—I’d really appreciate your input. I don’t want to stay silent anymore, but I also don’t want to destroy my future.\n\nThank you for reading.",

In a separate email thread to HR and finance, document that you have received your salary slip but according to your bank statements, you have not received the renumeration. Get them to confirm IN WRITING that you will be paid the appropriate renumeration. Attach both salary slip and bank statement for appropriate timeframe.   \n3. In another email thread, ask for clarification regarding PF claiming that you wanted to file PF partial withdrawal claim but noticed that last 1 year PF credit is pending. Please request them to look into it ASAP. \n\n4. Do the BARE minimum, but don't sabotage your tasks/projects and sign out on time. If a task takes 5 days but before you used to finish it in 3 days, now take the 5 days. Overestimate the ETAs when your manager asks. Use the free time to look for jobs, go to networking events, etc.",

I have been in this situation unable to pay salaries to my employees due to a big cheater client escaped without giving 10 lakhs for our service. First thing is my greed to get the project signed in that budget as a growing startup, second is not verifying the client background ( i did but not deeply like is he capable to pay that 10L ). These situations left me not able to pay full salaries to my employees for more than 3-4 months. Things went worse we started getting fake reviews on google and Facebook ads comments, LinkedIn posts about this issues and those things completely changed even our regular businesses to repay the amount for employees, at last we closed the company ( 5yrs old pvt ltd company )…..7 employees theft PC and laptops from office, around 10 employees sent legal notice, few others changed job immediately and only texted please pay whenever its possible. End of the day its my fault so i took full incharge and approached funds for interest and started new company again from scratch. My intention is to repay and bring back all the good employees so i did, i paid one by one it took 9 - 12 months to fully repay all their salaries - They gave back the assets stolen from company. Only 3 employee came back now we grew up 20 times more with the aggression of the failure we faced.                   Why I’m telling this story is : Once the company started falling nobody can stop it, all the legal case filed i faced the police call and explained they asked to repay i said it will take time and they said ok….all the legal notices i received not made any impact…..I closed and started new company again but i repaid…..if your founders are not genuine you will not get paid from them….If honestly they don’t have money to pay call them and try to get company assets as compensation and move on as soon as possible to a safe job and to manage the expenses do some freelance along….but don’t ever stay….even founders don’t know if they can get back from the situation or not…….If you’re in IT based or Digital Marketing based job you can ping for me for Freelance job for now I’m ready to support.",

I have been in this situation unable to pay salaries to my employees due to a big cheater client escaped without giving 10 lakhs for our service. First thing is my greed to get the project signed in that budget as a growing startup, second is not verifying the client background ( i did but not deeply like is he capable to pay that 10L ). These situations left me not able to pay full salaries to my employees for more than 3-4 months. Things went worse we started getting fake reviews on google and Facebook ads comments, LinkedIn posts about this issues and those things completely changed even our regular businesses to repay the amount for employees, at last we closed the company ( 5yrs old pvt ltd company )…..7 employees theft PC and laptops from office, around 10 employees sent legal notice, few others changed job immediately and only texted please pay whenever its possible. End of the day its my fault so i took full incharge and approached funds for interest and started new company again from scratch. My intention is to repay and bring back all the good employees so i did, i paid one by one it took 9 - 12 months to fully repay all their salaries - They gave back the assets stolen from company.

They are not going to pay you and its most likely that they wont get the money to pay you and even if they did, you have shown that its ok to treat you like a doormat. \n\nStop working for them. \n\nSince you mentioned you have been trying to get a job for 4 months, its maybe time to revisit your resume and your interview experiences and see whats going wrong. Have you gotten any feedback ?\n\n1. If you arent getting interviews, the only way out is to  start connecting with tech folks in Chennai/Bangalore/Hyd and get them to refer you to internal roles. Most companies have a hiring freeze going on, but you might get lucky. Hit up people from freshworks, zoho, chargebee etc. hell, even TCS, Wipros should be ok for now. Just get a job. \n2. Longterm: Create a nice profile on twitter. Start tweeting about the work you have done. Take some interest in couple of niche topics and start learning and just keep tweeting about them. So many tech hires happen on twitter. \n3. Look out for open source projects you can contribute to. Some of them will hire you based on the quality of your work.\n\nIf you are a bad engineer, its really hard. Only desperate companies with low packages will settle for bad engineers in this market. So, maybe think of what you can pivot to?",

They are not going to pay you and its most likely that they wont get the money to pay you and even if they did, you have shown that its ok to treat you like a doormat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop working for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you mentioned you have been trying to get a job for 4 months, its maybe time to revisit your resume and your interview experiences and see whats going wrong. Have you gotten any feedback ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you arent getting interviews, the only way out is to  start connecting with tech folks in Chennai/Bangalore/Hyd and get them to refer you to internal roles. Most companies have a hiring freeze going on, but you might get lucky. Hit up people from freshworks, zoho, chargebee etc. hell, even TCS, Wipros should be ok for now. Just get a job. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Longterm: Create a nice profile on twitter. Start tweeting about the work you have done. Take some interest in couple of niche topics and start learning and just keep tweeting about them. So many tech hires happen on twitter. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Look out for open source projects you can contribute to. Some of them will hire you based on the quality of your work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a bad engineer, its really hard.
