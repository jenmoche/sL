I’ve heard stories like your friend’s from the U.S. and even Ireland too — it’s honestly scary, especially since I come from a financially weak background and will be taking a huge loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe, especially &lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt;, is starting to look more attractive because of the &lt;strong&gt;lower tuition fees&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Blue Card PR route&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;better work-life balance&lt;/strong&gt;. The only concern I have there is the &lt;strong&gt;language barrier&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;slower job search&lt;/strong&gt;, especially without local German experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;New Zealand still tempts me&lt;/strong&gt; because of the simpler visa rules, peaceful lifestyle, and also because &lt;strong&gt;universities like the University of Auckland and University of Waikato offer a 1-trimester internship as part of the Master’s program&lt;/strong&gt;. That could be a really valuable opportunity to &lt;strong&gt;showcase my experience and skills&lt;/strong&gt; (I have 2 years in Android dev, including a team lead role) and possibly &lt;strong&gt;land a job&lt;/strong&gt; through that internship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree the tech market in NZ isn’t huge, but I’m hoping the local education + internship can help bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for the thoughtful input — really helps me weigh all sides before deciding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In Ireland, I’ve heard from many students that even getting a **part-time job is difficult**, and securing a **full-time role after graduation is even harder**.\n* **Housing crisis**: Ireland is also facing a major housing crisis. High rent, overcrowding, and limited availability are making life stressful for many international students there.\n* **Lower competition in NZ**: Compared to places like the US or Ireland, the competition in New Zealand is relatively low. The number of international CS students is also less, which *might* slightly increase my chances of finding work.\n* **Post-study work visa**: NZ offers a decent post-study work visa, and the lifestyle is more relaxed and balanced compared to other countries.\n\nThat said, I’m still evaluating everything because I know the risk is high either way. I’m open to hearing experiences from people in New Zealand too!",
