It's a haven for people who don't want to do DSA and only focus on development and where most companies work REMOTE globally. I have my example! This is my guide for my fellow juniors/seniors who have an interest in web3 and want to do well! I'll start with my background.\n\n**Background** \\- Final year CSE student in 8th semester at a Tier 2.5ish university. Currently, working at an Indian web3 crypto exchange (CEX+DEX) which has raised \\~$250M as an intern. PPO is verbally confirmed with manager. Before that, I was working as a freelancer at the same startup earning $1000 monthly in my 7th semester. Throughout my college duration, I have worked at 7+ startups. 3 of them being Web3 startups. 2 of them have raised a similar amount (\\~$10-12M) and third one being my current startup. I have been an 8 times hackathon winner. (7 web3 Hackathon + 1 web2 Hackathon). Been paying my college fees since my 6th semester (close to \\~2L every semester). Haven't asked for a penny from my parents after my 4th semester ended, financed all my expenses, college trips with friends (to multiple locations in India last one being in Goa ;) all by myself, as well as bought gifts for all of my family members, friends and girlfriend! Last year itself, I earned closed to \\~9L by freelancing, hackathons and web3, while being a full-time college student which had a 85%(changed to 75, in my last year) attendance policy btw!\n\nAll of this sounds pretty cool but I had to grind my ass off in order to do this. I did not do DSA at all (solved around 92 questions on Leetcode throughout my 4 years of college) so doubted myself all the time if I am doing the right thing, college CG was fucked because of doing multiple interns (3 interns at once during PEAK), finally barely completing my 7th semester with a 7.5+ CG. Did not sit for on-campus placements because no web3 companies, CG was barely good and almost all of them asked DSA, had to work extra hard for off campus + web3 companies, used to apply for 1-2 hours daily, give multiple interviews every week.\n\n**The Guide -**\n\nIf all of this interests you and you want to make a career in Web3, I want to help you.\n\n1. **Hackathons** \\- One thing I found irreplaceable was hackathons. Participate in as many hackathons as you can. There's a new web3 hackathon happening every week with MILLIONS in bounties and I am not kidding. For an example, check [this](https://ethdenver2025.devfolio.co/prizes) out. The last global web3 hackathon that happened and the bounties is worth 1 FUCKING MILLION. This was an in-person hackathon in Denver but multiple hackathons like this keep happening throughout the season and you can participate in them REMOTELY. Last web3 hackathon that I won with my friends, we won $5600, and we aren't geniuses. All you need to win a web3 hackathon is a good idea, and clarity and execution. You don't even need a finished product, I have seen plenty of projects winning thousands of dollars with unfinished products, that's the coolest thing about web3. Your idea matters! Go checkout more hackathons at ETHGlobal and Devfolio.\n2. **Fellowships/Grants** \\- There are multiple projects/protocols which want you to build on them and in turn, they will give you money to learn and then build a decent project on them. My friend (who is btw currently working remotely with a web3 startup in Brussels and earning 1.3L/month, same 7th sem student as me) has done 3 of these fellowships. The first fellowship gave me 50K INR and a fully sponsored 1 week trip to Dharamsala where they built their product. The second fellowship gave was for 8 weeks, paid him $2000, first few weeks were based on learning the new protocol and last few weeks were based on building their product. The last fellowship was learning, building and a fully sponsored trip to Dubai for 5 days :) Think web3's cool now? I myself have been a recipient of a $3000 Grant for building my product on a specific protocol.\n3. **Connections** \\- In Web3, the one thing that matters more than anything is the connections that you make along the way. It has helped me. It has helped my friends and it will for sure, help you. Web3 is such a closely knitted community, especially within India, those connections will take you a long way. Be active on Twitter, Linkedin and Reddit. Keep scouting good projects, talk with founders, attend meetups (which also happen every few weeks), talk to people at hackathons. It will definitely help you!\n4. **Keep Building** \\- Web3 isn't all that easy. We are at the brink where Web3's just getting mainstream. And this industry is so fucking fast-paced, it's hard to keep up with the latest developments. People were shilling on NFTs, then memecoins then it was Abstraction, then AI agents last year, and now suddenly, it's all about memecoins again. You need to be passionate about this space. You need to keep learning and exploring to keep up with all the trends, keep building and keep participating in hackathons so you can always be industry ready,\n5. **Resources?** \\- I'd say start watching any good playlist to get an intro what reallt blockchain/web3 is all about. Then, if you want to get into development, switch to Cyfrin Updraft (the only resource for learning web3 dev I will recommend). Then build a few good projects. Be active on Twitter (very important), 70% of the web3 community resides on Twitter. Start applying left and right :) That's it.\n\nI hope this helped. I wish to make a separate thread to explain my journey as well. So I'll save it for another thread. If you're really passionate about transparency and web3, then only get into this space. We already have enough people who have made this space infamous. It is looked on as a Ponzi scheme, a quick way to get rich and nobody is appreciating the underlying tech. If you care about the tech, are passionate about this space, you will make it for sure. Otherwise, you won't. If you're only here for the money, might as well stick to whatever you're doing. I am super grateful to web3, I respect the space, the people and love the passion this space brings into the tech world.\n\nI'd love to answer questions related to my career, my future plans and web3. I hope this helped. Thanks a lot, guys!",
