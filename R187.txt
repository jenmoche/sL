Are these jobs very few, tough market or whatever the case is  i would like to know. \n\nSwitching up right  now wouldn't be difficult, i would like to know what is in store for me in the long term what's the catch here, Everything is hard but i want to choose my hard which should be worth it in the end. As i knew what would await me in marketing roles in the future. \n\n the reason i am thinking about this is because digital marketing field is not a piece of cake, You need to be active &amp; adaptable and always learn new things according to changing market,  as experience increases you will naturally go into more senior marketing roles but the problem is these roles are achieved mostly through promotions in same company and the biggest reason i hate it is because if you lose your job at senior level re-entry into same position and income is very hard as those roles are rare to begin with and as an outsider getting those roles are nearly impossible. which is not the case for senior corporate lawyers \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you, all kinds of opinions and suggestions are welcome ",

Law Firm Recruitment Works Differently\nThe reason you don’t see many job postings for corporate lawyers is that recruitment at good firms is more agency-driven and heavily relies on referrals and campus placements. Most Tier 1 and Tier 2 firms hire straight from law schools, lateral hiring is mostly through networks, and direct job postings are rare unless for niche roles.\n\n2. Starting at a Law Firm Isn’t That Intense\nThe first year at a law firm, while demanding, isn’t as crazy as people make it seem—especially if you’re just starting out and still learning the ropes. It’s tough but not impossible to balance other pursuits, especially if you want to test the waters with digital marketing.\n\n3. Every Tier 1 Lawyer is Fed Up Eventually\nMost lawyers in top firms end up frustrated with the job. The pay is great, but the work-life balance is brutal, and career growth is linear but slow. People either pivot to in-house roles for a more stable life, move abroad, or quit altogether.\n\n4. Digital Marketing is More Future-Proof\nGiven the level of creativity and adaptability involved, digital marketing looks like a field with longevity. Unlike law, where AI is already replacing grunt work, digital marketing rewards personal brand-building and unique skills that aren’t as easily automated.\n\n5. Try Both, Then Decide\nIf you’re serious about switching, take the law firm job for a year while continuing digital marketing on the side. Worst case, if digital marketing doesn’t pan out, you’ll have legal experience to fall back on. Best case, you build something solid and transition full-time without regrets.\n\nA calculated risk is always better than an impulsive switch. Hope this helps!",
