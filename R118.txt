If you want to read the leetcode post I made,* [*here it is.*](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6768482/my-job-switch-journey-4-yoe-sde-2-backen-kcsh/)\n\nHi all,\n\nI recently concluded my job switch journey.\n\n**About me:** 3y 7m yoe as a backend engineer at a fintech company in India\n\n**Application Stats**\n\n        Stage                                Count\n        -----------------------------------  -----\n        Applied                              65\n        Heard back                           15\n        Ghosted after OA                     3\n        Interviews                           10\n        Ghosted after interviews             4\n        Converted to offer                   2\n        Dropped off from interview pipeline  4\n\nI didn't particularly target FAANG companies. I applied to all kinds: Amazon, Google, Meta (BLR), Microsoft, Motive, Neotap, Target, Databricks, Zeta, etc to name a few.\n\n**LC stats:**  \n36E + 501M + 79H = 616.  \nNote: I genuinely don't think you would need to solve this many, btw.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n    Dec '24: Started grinding LC vigorously. This was one of my best months tbh. \n    Jan '25: Started applying \n    Feb '25 end to mid Mar '25: Interviews \n    End of Mar '25: Signed OL\n\n**Prep Strategy**\n\n**DSA:** I started with the Neetcode 250 list. In the beginning, 1 simple easy question took around 15 minutes for me because my DSA out of touch after almost 3 years. After that, I practiced topic by topic by sorting them frequency wise. This helped me build confidence.\n\nLC Premium subscription is worth it if you are interviewing for companies like Amazon, Microsoft, LinkedIn, etc.\n\n**LLD:** [This repo](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-low-level-design) is all you need. Learn and study design patterns ([this is a good start](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)), and start implementing problems one by one from that repo.\n\n**HLD:** I started with [this course](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-system-design-fundamentals) from design gurus to learn the fundamentals. I moved on to read Alex Xu (both volumes) and Hello Interview blogs. Yes, Hello Interview premium subscription is worth the money. I practiced drawing diagrams on pen and paper then moved on to excalidraw.\n\nFor SDE-2 this is enough imo. If you are interviewing for L5+ roles I would suggest reading DDIA, going through [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTveVh7FakJOoY6GPZGWHHl4shhDT8iV&amp;si=IrLdTccM_zBbu6hO) from Jordan Has No Life (great content btw).\n\n# Interview Experiences\n\n**Salesforce - SMTS &amp; Uber - SDE 2:** Ghosted after OA\n\n**Motive - SSE:** Recruiter sent an email asking about onsites availability, but never heard back from her after multiple follow-ups. Their interview process is 1 DSA, 1 HLD, and 1 HM rounds.\n\n**Digital Ocean - SSE:** Cleared OA, DSA, HLD. Got very \"egoistic\" vibes from the interviewer for the HLD round. He interrupted me in b/w multiple times, was not listening to what I was saying. After this round, I wasn't keen to interview with them again, so I dropped off.\n\n**Meesho - SDE 2:** This was one of the companies I interviewed for but wasn't that excited to join because of the work culture. Gave DSA and LLD rounds.\n\n[**Onlinesales.ai**](http://Onlinesales.ai) **- SDE 2:** Like Meesho, these were my \"practice\" interviews. Cleared all their rounds and rejected their offer.\n\n**Jupiter - SDE 2 &amp; Groww - SDE 2:** I heard back from these companies after I received an offer from LinkedIn, so I was upfront with them about the compensation. They were not ready to match it so I didn't interview with them.\n\n**Cred &amp; Neotap - SDE 2:** My first ever LLD round. Failed horribly but it was a good lesson. Was ghosted after that.\n\n[**Observe.ai**](http://Observe.ai) **- SDE 2:** Cleared OA, 2 LLD rounds. Dropped off from the interview pipeline. Their interview process is OA, 2 LLD, 2 HM rounds.\n\n**Google - L4:** Cleared Phone screen. Dropped off from the interview pipeline.\n\nPhone screen happend in early March and onsites were scheduled to happen in mid May. So by that time, my DSA was rusty again.\n\nI know it sounds very stupid, but for me, preparing for Google onsites felt like memorizing solutions from LC discuss section and this is not how I want to prepare for Google. I made a decision to interview with them later, if given a chance -- with much better problem solving skills.\n\n**Hackerrank - SDE 2:** Rejected after HM round. [Experience](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6556472/hackerrank-sde-2-backend-interview-exper-6rek/)\n\n**Gojek - SWE:** Received verbal communication about the offer, but was rejected later. [Experience](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6536214/gojek-goto-group-sde-2-interview-experie-934r/)\n\n**Coinbase - IC4:** Rejected after onsites. [Experience](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6746894/coinbase-ic4-interview-experience-india-eo0b7/)\n\n**LinkedIn - SWE:** Received an offer. [Experience](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6549646/linkedin-swe-applications-interview-expe-l8p4/)\n\n**Amazon - SDE 2:** Received an offer. [Experience](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6745223/amazon-sde-2-interview-experience-india-1nma0/)\n\nLooking back, I would have made below changes in my job switch journey:\n\n1. Start interview prep much sooner, even if not vigorously, maybe at least 3 problems a day.\n2. Craft a simple, concise (and impactful) message to cold message/email recruiters. I took referrals for only Microsoft and Wayfair and recevied rejects from both of them. Rest all, I applied on careers site or LinkedIn.\n3. Instead of depending solely on leetcode (even though this is enough) for problem solving, do [cses.fi](http://cses.fi) set or atcoder problems to keep my skills sharp.\n4. Read chapters on data replication, partitioning, consistency, batch &amp; stream processing from DDIA.\n5. Learn about the internals of distributed systems.\n\nI have no regrets whatsoever. I still have some time before I join, so I most likely work on the above points.\n\nHappy interviewing, you guys! Good luck!\n\nCheers\\~",
