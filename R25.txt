            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'm at a crossroads in my life and could really use some advice.\n\n**Background:**  \nI came to the US with dreams of building a career and a better life. I did my Master's in CS, landed a summer internship at a Fortune 500 easily, but struggled for a year to find a full-time job, eventually landing a tech role at a university. It only pays $60k/year and doesn’t offer H1B sponsorship. I have 2 years left on my OPT, and with the current job market, getting a sponsoring job and winning the H1B lottery seems unlikely. All this has really got me second-guessing my stability and future in this country, leaving me with two options:\n\n**OPTION 1: Marry / Stay in the US**\n\n* My girlfriend is a US citizen (Indian American) and we've discussed marriage.\n* To stay here, I’d need to marry by the end of next year, but I don't feel secure in my career or finances.\n* My current job doesn’t offer much learning or growth, and getting a better role seems impossible until I get a green card (could be 3+ years from now) and difficult even after that.\n* There is a constant scare of layoffs and the future of the tech industry remains uncertain.\n* Future financial pressures of buying a house, starting a family, etc. (I'm in a T2 MCOL city)\n* She is firm about never moving to India - I have to commit to being here for the rest of my life\n* Might be hard to take care of parents in India long term\n* Clean air, nice infrastructure, many things to do, good quality of life if you make good money, but life seems hard??\n\n**OPTION 2: Break up / Move Back to India after OPT**\n\n* I’m an only child, and my parents and I have a combined net worth of ₹8-10 Cr.\n* Our passive/rental income covers all expenses with \\~₹1L left over monthly. I have my own house and car, allowing a comfortable life without financial stress.\n* Any money I earn on my own would be \"fun money\". I'd also have the flexibility to take a few years off if I wanted to start a business, and not care if it failed (I have office space too)\n* I'd be close to my parents, friends, and family\n* Domestic help is affordable\n* I live in one of the best areas of an Indian Tier-2 city. The air is clean, the infrastructure is decent, and traffic is not an issue - a great place to live! However, if things don't work out there, I might have to move to BLR/HYD for employment, pay rent (I wouldn't be able to live in my house), be away from my family, and deal with the traffic, pollution, work culture, etc. -- Why I decided to move to the US in the first place LOL\n* Rampant corruption everywhere\n* Although I would have to end my relationship here and deal with the challenges of living in India, life there seems easier??\n\n**TL;DR:** **My US career hasn't taken off as I hoped. Should I stay in the US, get married, and navigate career and financial instability, or move back to India where I'd have financial security and family support, but face the typical challenges of living there?**\n\nI’d love to hear from NRIs who chose to live in the US long-term and start families, as well as those who moved back to India. How hard is life with mortgages, raising kids, and managing stress in the US? After budgeting for your children's future, do you still have savings and \"fun money\"? Or am I underestimating the challenges of life in India and overthinking life in the US?\n\nI need to decide soon, and whatever I decide will be IRREVOCABLE. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nNote: I have no financial dependents and no debt. I got into a fully funded MS program and also an RA position that paid all my living expenses until I landed my current job :)",

                                          "body": "Oops my bad then! Thanks for your response! This makes it clearer. To address your points -\n\nYes, you're right. Challenges and complexities are indeed intrinsic to all relationships. The reason it sounds as though I'm contemplating abandoning the relationship so easily is because there's more to this story.\n\nGC Escape Hatch: Sure, getting a GC will indeed downgrade the impact of these problems. But I was still concerned as I have several qualified tech professionals in my circles (all US Citizens) who were unemployed and struggling for months on end when they got laid off. At least they could temporarily move back into their parents' homes - something I can't do. Heck my GF's own brother has been unemployed for over a year despite being a US Citizen, coming from a Top 5 school, and having 4 years of work ex! It's pretty scary seeing this all around you. But okay, for the sake of argument let's move on and assume that this will be a non-issue for me.\n\nMore to the story:  My GF is very close to her family, and is unwilling to move to India even temporarily. If I needed to move alone temporarily for my family, she would understand, but wouldn't move with me unless I was just visiting for a brief period. Her compromise is agreeing to retire in India (she says that now, but if we have kids here, idk if she will comply in the future). Forget moving to India, she is even reluctant to move elsewhere within the United States! This severely restricts my mobility for future employment. To add to that, she wants us to buy a house (at least $400k) AND have kids 3 years from now. She also wants me to take on all the financial burden of the family (including the mortgage), while she will be a SAHM after having kids. That would mean being tied down to this city, taking on an 8% 30-YEAR mortgage on my (low) salary, while only having maybe $50-60k savings at the time. She's still adamant that I should go ahead with this plan bc housing prices are going up and we shouldn't waste money on rent. While that is true, it doesn't sound practical to me.\n\nI might be able to push back a little on the house and SAHM stuff, but overall it's making me feel like I'm taking on huge financial risk while losing out on all flexibility. If I was making a lot of money, maybe I wouldn't have been as worried. But as of now it doesn't look feasible to me, and my friends and family feel the same. Her expectations and timelines are very rigid. Any counter-arguments I make are received with \"I grew up in this country. I know what's best here. My parents did this, it's normal, etc etc. We’ll manage; you’re overthinking it\". Obviously, as an immigrant, I have no choice at that moment but to believe her. Makes me doubt myself sometimes. Oh and she wants a $10k+ engagement ring too :') That's 5 months' worth of savings on my current salary. And I've only been working for 2 months!\n\nWhen I asked her what we'd do if I got laid off in the future on a single income, her answer was \"You've gotta hustle. Take up a part-time job or drive Uber to make ends meet\" while all I wanted to hear was \"Don't worry, I'll handle it until you can get back on your feet\". I don't think she means it in a bad way, but I'm beginning to think that our outlook on life and upbringing just might be vastly different.\n\nThe reason I didn't mention all this before is because I wanted to separate my issues into two questions - 1. US vs India: What is better for ME long term? -- the purpose of my post 2. Am I sure I want to marry my GF? If the answer to Q1 is India (based on my situation outlined in OP) then it would make answering Q2 easier for me. I'm not taking this decision on a whim. I have given this relationship my all, and adjusted to everything that's been asked of me so far. And although she is a very nice person overall, I really need to think about what's best for me going forward. I've been reflecting a lot, and talking things through with her, my parents, and my friends. I am ready to handle all the challenges as a team, but I'm not confident that she is. This is just making me see the negatives about everything.\n\nIf I were to get a GC tomorrow: No, I would first buy time and try to sort out any issues we have. We have encountered issues before, but we've worked on resolving them and never thought of abandoning the relationship. I would try to uplift my career and delay the marriage until I was ready to take on these financial responsibilities. Given my visa timeline, I'm currently stuck in a Catch-22 situation. I want to get a better job before marriage, but also need to marry to be able to get a GC which can land me a better job. Can't delay the marriage either, because if I want to stay in the country, we would need to marry next year and start planning NOW. Therefore, I have to make this decision quickly. I don't want to waste her time either. \n\nGiven the additional context, what are your thoughts? Do you think it's a, b, or both? Does it also make more sense now, why I'm finding my financial blanket in India so appealing?",

To address your points -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you&amp;#39;re right. Challenges and complexities are indeed intrinsic to all relationships. The reason it sounds as though I&amp;#39;m contemplating abandoning the relationship so easily is because there&amp;#39;s more to this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GC Escape Hatch: Sure, getting a GC will indeed downgrade the impact of these problems. But I was still concerned as I have several qualified tech professionals in my circles (all US Citizens) who were unemployed and struggling for months on end when they got laid off. At least they could temporarily move back into their parents&amp;#39; homes - something I can&amp;#39;t do. Heck my GF&amp;#39;s own brother has been unemployed for over a year despite being a US Citizen, coming from a Top 5 school, and having 4 years of work ex! It&amp;#39;s pretty scary seeing this all around you. But okay, for the sake of argument let&amp;#39;s move on and assume that this will be a non-issue for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More to the story:  My GF is very close to her family, and is unwilling to move to India even temporarily. If I needed to move alone temporarily for my family, she would understand, but wouldn&amp;#39;t move with me unless I was just visiting for a brief period. Her compromise is agreeing to retire in India (she says that now, but if we have kids here, idk if she will comply in the future). Forget moving to India, she is even reluctant to move elsewhere within the United States! This severely restricts my mobility for future employment. To add to that, she wants us to buy a house (at least $400k) AND have kids 3 years from now. She also wants me to take on all the financial burden of the family (including the mortgage), while she will be a SAHM after having kids. That would mean being tied down to this city, taking on an 8% 30-YEAR mortgage on my (low) salary, while only having maybe $50-60k savings at the time. She&amp;#39;s still adamant that I should go ahead with this plan bc housing prices are going up and we shouldn&amp;#39;t waste money on rent. While that is true, it doesn&amp;#39;t sound practical to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might be able to push back a little on the house and SAHM stuff, but overall it&amp;#39;s making me feel like I&amp;#39;m taking on huge financial risk while losing out on all flexibility. If I was making a lot of money, maybe I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been as worried. But as of now it doesn&amp;#39;t look feasible to me, and my friends and family feel the same. Her expectations and timelines are very rigid. Any counter-arguments I make are received with &amp;quot;I grew up in this country. I know what&amp;#39;s best here. My parents did this, it&amp;#39;s normal, etc etc. We’ll manage; you’re overthinking it&amp;quot;. Obviously, as an immigrant, I have no choice at that moment but to believe her. Makes me doubt myself sometimes. Oh and she wants a $10k+ engagement ring too :&amp;#39;) That&amp;#39;s 5 months&amp;#39; worth of savings on my current salary. And I&amp;#39;ve only been working for 2 months!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked her what we&amp;#39;d do if I got laid off in the future on a single income, her answer was &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve gotta hustle. Take up a part-time job or drive Uber to make ends meet&amp;quot; while all I wanted to hear was &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;ll handle it until you can get back on your feet&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t think she means it in a bad way, but I&amp;#39;m beginning to think that our outlook on life and upbringing just might be vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;#39;t mention all this before is because I wanted to separate my issues into two questions - 1. US vs India: What is better for ME long term? -- the purpose of my post 2. Am I sure I want to marry my GF? If the answer to Q1 is India (based on my situation outlined in OP) then it would make answering Q2 easier for me. I&amp;#39;m not taking this decision on a whim. I have given this relationship my all, and adjusted to everything that&amp;#39;s been asked of me so far. And although she is a very nice person overall, I really need to think about what&amp;#39;s best for me going forward. I&amp;#39;ve been reflecting a lot, and talking things through with her, my parents, and my friends. I am ready to handle all the challenges as a team, but I&amp;#39;m not confident that she is. This is just making me see the negatives about everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to get a GC tomorrow: No, I would first buy time and try to sort out any issues we have. We have encountered issues before, but we&amp;#39;ve worked on resolving them and never thought of abandoning the relationship. I would try to uplift my career and delay the marriage until I was ready to take on these financial responsibilities. Given my visa timeline, I&amp;#39;m currently stuck in a Catch-22 situation. I want to get a better job before marriage, but also need to marry to be able to get a GC which can land me a better job. Can&amp;#39;t delay the marriage either, because if I want to stay in the country, we would need to marry next year and start planning NOW. Therefore, I have to make this decision quickly. I don&amp;#39;t want to waste her time either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the additional context, what are your thoughts? Do you think it&amp;#39;s a, b, or both? Does it also make more sense now, why I&amp;#39;m finding my financial blanket in India so appealing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I already have a house, car, and office space. My parents also make surplus passive income and are willing to give me \\~50k INR / month to meet my expenses. That allows me to take more risks with my career, try business, freelancing, etc. I don't intend to touch that 8-10Cr at all, and rather pass that down to my future generations. Why do you feel that won't be enough?\n\nI agree that my career might be better in the US, but with my GF not wanting to work after having kids, and not being open to relocation, I'm not sure if I can have a comfortable life here on a single income. I'm expecting monthly expenses to be between $5000-6000 for a basic lifestyle with a kid. Even if I make $120k (2x what I'm making now), that means I'll save only $1000/month after taxes and retirement. That's WILD. I'll probably save more in India LOL. Salaries in my state top at \\~160k base, so there's not much room for improvement either. And god help me if I get laid off in the midst of this.\n\n&gt;Were your parents salaried employees, or own a business. If you do not have any family connections in business, you will be comparing yourself to business people in India who are making 10x your income.\n\nMy parents are both business owners. My mom has her own clinic, and my father ran a Software Dev agency for 30 years. He's semi-retired now, and supports only one client. Idk if it can be revived with things having changed today, but it remains an option if I want to try. I have a starting point. I have office space too.\n\nMy friend circle back home consists of mostly salaried people that come from similar backgrounds as me. We all live comfortably, but not luxuriously. A lot of my friends in the US are struggling rn and even the ones with jobs are considering going back home due to the instability. So I don't think comparison will be an issue. As long as I can live a comfortable life, build onto the wealth I inherit, spend time with family, not live an intensely stressful life, and provide for my kids' future like my parents did to me, I will be happy. \n\nDo you still think I should stay?",

One medical issue can lead to bankruptcy and you cannot afford to remain unemployed even for a short time because of fixed expenses- do you really want to live in that kind of stress all the time?\n\nI completely agree! These are my thoughts exactly. When you're young, you tend to look at the pros - high savings, cheaper electronics, infrastructure, affordability of international travel, etc. But long term when you're married with kids, you see the flip side. Savings aren't high anymore, housing is getting expensive, education expenses are HIGH, healthcare costs are EVEN HIGHER, no time for vacations when you use all your leave to visit home, having to take care of your parents as they age, etc. With all this going on, I don't think I would care about better infrastructure, cheaper electronics, etc. LOL. The only other good thing here is the WLB and work environment, but even there, with one setback, your life could come crumbling down like a house of cards. Definitely do not want that kind of stress! Of course, India has its fair share of issues, but at least they're not THIS stressful. The purpose of my post was to determine whether I was blowing things out of proportion, or if my concerns were valid. I feel very validated haha thank you for sharing your thoughts!\n\n&gt;Is it even sustainable when you know you have an alternative. You can always take vacations abroad to experience the pros of western culture but the convenience and social setup in India is miles ahead of any western country.\n\nNope, not sustainable unless you and your partner both have well-paying jobs. Even that comes with the sacrifice of not being as present in your kids' lives. Social setup is definitely better in India, and like you said, you can always save up and vacation abroad every few years.\n\n&gt;I don’t plan to have kids and I have invested in a house in India so I am cruising through a few years in the uk but there is no way I am going to settle here for good despite all the pros of free healthcare and good work life balance. When you have a viable option you are very much justified in thinking about how you want to lead your life in the future considering all the risks and uncertainties that go with it. Like you, I too want a stress free life where I’ll be more content and will enjoy the little moments than working my whole life making someone else richer!\n\nAmen to that! I agree with everything you said 👌\n\nIf you've already invested in a house, don't plan on having kids, and want to save up in the UK before eventually returning to India, you can have a great life without too much stress IMO. I really resonated with the \"Enjoying the little moments than working my whole life to make someone else richer\" part  💯 We think alike haha.",

But the question is, am I underestimating the amount of peace of mind I'll have with a career in tech here? Given I'll be paying a mortgage and supporting a wife and kids. In my head it feels like I'll just be working all the time and saving all my life -- which is something I won't have to do in India.\n\nMy priority is to have a financially stable, comfortable life with minimal stress.
