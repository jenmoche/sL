If I fail to get a good job after my degree, repaying this will be a serious burden.\n\nI’m also considering other countries like:\n\n* Ireland\n* Germany\n* France\n* Australia\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is it worth risking this loan for New Zealand?\n* Would countries like Ireland or Germany offer better ROI and post-study opportunities?\n* Should I continue working in India and wait for a better/safer option?",

Students from Trinity and UCD ( these are best of ireland) struggle to get decent jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality is bit different for everyone and determination of an individual is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sense you will succeed, but check type of jobs you want to do after masters as of today and number of students in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That will give you a fair idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example here in ireland we have 1000s of data science students but only handful of jobs in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
