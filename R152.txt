            "selftext": "1. MBBS Seats Have Exploded—But PG Seats Haven’t\n\t\n•\tThen: In 2010, there were around 30,000 MBBS seats across India.\n\n•\tNow (2024–25): Over 1,08,000 MBBS seats, but only around 64,000 PG seats.\n\n•\tResult: Massive competition for PG, longer waiting periods, multiple attempts at NEET-PG (or NEXT), and a huge surplus of general physicians with no specialization—bringing down wages.\n\n⸻\n\n2. NEET &amp; NEXT Standardized the Game—But Also Broke It\n\t\n•\tThen: Different states had their own entrance systems; some flexibility existed.\n\t\n•\tNow: NEET made it one big race. NEXT (the upcoming national exit test) will decide both your MBBS passing status and PG seat—no second chances.\n\t\n•\tResult: Even after slogging through MBBS, your career hinges on one national test that filters over a lakh students for limited PG seats. It’s no longer enough to just “get into MBBS.”\n\n⸻\n\n3. Salaries Have Not Kept Up with Inflation or Skill\n\t\n•\tThen: A government MBBS doctor could expect ₹50–60k per month after internship in 2010—respectable then.\n\t\n•\tNow: Many hospitals still offer ₹30–40k/month for MBBS freshers. No benefits. No holidays. Often as “RMO” (Resident Medical Officer), which is glorified clerical work.\n\t\n•\tMeanwhile: A BCom grad from SRCC + MBA from a tier 2 college often makes ₹10–12 LPA by 25 years of age. Engineers at startups make ₹15–18 LPA easily.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Rise of Health-Tech and AI: Shifting Value Elsewhere\n\t\n•\tThen: Healthcare meant clinics and hospitals. Doctors were gatekeepers of knowledge.\n\t\n•\tNow: Telemedicine, AI diagnostics (like Qure.ai), and app-based consultations have started automating routine clinical work.\n\t\n•\tResult: The market value of just an MBBS degree is falling—while non-clinical fields like health product management, medical writing, and insurance are booming (but under-recognized by most MBBS students).\n\n⸻\n\n5. Shift in Aspirations and Global Comparisons\n\t\n•\tThen: Most students were content with a stable job by 30.\n\t\n•\tNow: Gen Z wants flexibility, work-life balance, mental health, and income parity with peers in tech and business.\n\t\n•\tA doctor doing 36-hour shifts for ₹50k/month sees her college friend taking international vacations on a WFH job. The comparison is brutal—and legitimate.\n\n⸻\n\n6. Rise of Private Medical Colleges &amp; Capitation\n\t\n•\tThen: MBBS was prestigious and rare. Only top students got in.\n\t\n•\tNow: Private colleges sell seats for ₹1 crore+, flooding the market with doctors, many of whom don’t even want to practice clinically.\n\t\n•\tResult: Oversupply + underpaid internships + job scarcity = a crowded, disillusioned profession.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Social Media Broke the Illusion\n\t\n•\tOn Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube, doctors now openly share stories of burnout, poor salaries, and switching careers—something that was taboo even 5 years ago.\n\t\n•\tYou’re not the only one feeling this. The collective narrative is shifting from “doctor = god” to “doctor = underpaid service worker unless very lucky or very strategic.”\n\n⸻\n\nSo no, you’re not imagining it. The world has moved on, but the perception of the profession hasn’t. That mismatch is exactly what you’ve been feeling. \n\n\n\nPS: Had to rope in ChatGPT to help articulate this mess because burnout ",
