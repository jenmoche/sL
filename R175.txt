If I could save one kid from the torment of head over heart decisions, I definitely would. No second thoughts.\n\nComing to the point here! There are many many verticals in art that would pay you decently given that you are good at understanding the specific deliverables each vertical demands.\n\nBut firstly, you should decide on what sort of art career you'd want to pursue! These are a few I find very interesting:\n\nUI (along with UX) - very important these days as every business in existence needs a UI designer (UX skill too) for their product/service. Graphic Design would be a subset of this. Think website and app design, creatives for social media and brand campaigns, and much more. You'd learn to think how a design would affect a consumer in great depth. It'd be a mixture of Art and Marketing. Hopefully established designers can add more here!\n\n3D-design - Basically UnReal Engine, Blender etc. Amazing area to be specializing in imo. The opportunities can be endless. Animator, Game Designer, AR/VR app designer (this in itself is another amazing space), Film VFX,  \nI know of comic artists who use UnReal to make their backgrounds!\n\nDesign is when you love art and marketing. Read Bruno Munari's Design as Art. He talks about how a designer is the new age artist. And how a designer is very much important in todays day and age.\n\nBut if you love art and storytelling, Comic Art and Animation are great avenues. This again is a very interesting place to be. I am currently working on a comic myself. It's a very fun process. From writing the story to storyboarding, character design, and everything else involved. Animation again has many media that you can explore - clay, puppets etc.\n\nYou could also take the Fine Arts route but it's regarded to be much tougher. But you can still make money! There are many artists who earn through YouTube, teach (sell courses online, conduct workshops, teach art in person), do commission works, etc.\n\nBut apart from these there are many types of design these days - Product Design (physical products and software), Service Design (intersection of Marketing and Business Strategy), Experience Design (a step further from UX), Lighting Design (I love this too! Commercial Lighting Design is just amazing! Really it is a subset of Experience Design imo but very specific knowledge of LEDs and software), Interior, etc.\n\nI'd suggest you to go through NID's website once. And get to know more about the degrees they offer. Also check out the subreddits of whichever art/design career that catches your attention. Since in the question you haven't zeroed on anything yet, I hope you think divergently first. Know about every art/design career. And then think convergently to zero down on what you actually want to pursue.\n\nNo matter the vertical you take, you definitely need a strong brand value as an artist (read social media presence)  \nWhichever you choose, work on portfolio pieces. Have a strong portfolio.\n\nI guess my answer might still be a little vague but I hope it helps you some way or the other! Also keep us all updated here! I'll be rooting for you!\n\nEdit: \n\n1. the safe route out being Engineering.\n\n2. I'd also ask you to understand that as of now every damn career is saturated. That shouldn't stop you from pursuing your dreams. Have faith in yourself. And more importantly work hard to hone your craft. That's the only difference between those who crib about competition and those who are above it.",
